RESPONSE STYLE:
Hmm, that's a great question! While I don't have the specific details about this in my current knowledge base, I definitely want to make sure you get the right information.

Here's what I'd recommend to get you the exact answer you need:

1. **Check the Jupiter app** - The help section often has the most current info
2. **Visit jupiter.money** - Our website has comprehensive guides
3. **Contact our support team** directly through the app - they'll have access to your account details

I really wish I could give you the exact answer right now, but I want to make sure you get accurate, up-to-date information rather than guessing.

Is there anything else about Jupiter's banking services that I might be able to help with in the meantime?
