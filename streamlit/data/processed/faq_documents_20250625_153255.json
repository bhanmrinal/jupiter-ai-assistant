I went to the nearest federal Bank and updated my phone number over there and I had filled the email address ed on the form. They said I‚Äôd get access to Jupiter in 24hrs. Now that I am trying to  to my Jupiter, it shows a message that ‚Äúthe email is address is ed to another number (old number)‚Äù. I reached out to your customer support via call and chat number of times which I found to be a complete waste of time and energy. I had no issue with updating phone number at Kotak Mahindra which is my salary account. Why do you guys have no way of verifying an existing user other than phone number? I even got my Pan card and aadhar updated while you guys still have trouble sorting my issue out. Not even a ticket numbe was raised even after reaching out so many times. How can I trust someone  you when I have my savings pot stuck inside it? Is there no way for your system to authenticate an existing customer other than using phone number? Wow‚Ä¶ explains a great lot of security in keeping the money inside the account, heh!",

When I add my mobile number, it says Mobile number update initiated. And I cannot move forward from here. I got in touch with customer support and after a few discussions, they got to know the issue. The phone number I used for onboarding was associated with a different customer‚Äôs account in their system. And due to company policy, they‚Äôre unable to delete or modify this data from their database. I recently got a new phone number and linked it with my Aadhaar & PAN. I also have a federal account with this new number. But I cannot for some reason create a Jupiter account because some X customer had used my new number ly. Now I cannot onboard Jupiter because of the said issue. The customer support says I can onboard if I get a new sim and gets it linked to my Aadhaar/PAN and that‚Äôs a long, hectic process which I do not want to go through. Please allow users to create an account with any number as long as it‚Äôs linked with their Aadhar and PAN. Follow the same while they change their number. This is a very lame issue and we should fix it. Any help is welcome. 3 s",
