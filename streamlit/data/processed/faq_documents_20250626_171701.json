In my Jupiter app it shows as verified so I have no way of doing it again. This leaves me with no access to my money! Im getting no reply to any of my emails.

    "question": "Favourite pots for quick access",
    "answer": "keeithvz (Keith) 11 April 2025 05:34 1 It would be great to have some kind of quick access to 2-3 pots of my choice either on the home screen or on the pots page. The way I use pots is that I deposit money very frequently into some of them but the issue is that the pots I deposit into are buried deep into ‚ÄúView all‚Äù list. It gets mentally exhausting to have to go through a total of 3 clicks, the added cognitive load and distractions along the way to just add 200Rs to a pot. It would make my life a lot easier if I had access to some of my pots that I could either favorite or pin, either in the home screen or at the pots page to help with this. Another idea could also be widgets in iOS to allow for quick access to the pots of our choice. Or even the long press on an icon. Some kind of quick access is all I‚Äôm asking for. What if Jupiter just gave different parts of the app quick access to the user based on their personal needs and niche usages. Make them all quick-accessible in some way. For me it‚Äôs pots for someone else it could be gold. Who knows. All in all I think Jupiter has reached a mature stage in design and it‚Äôs time to focus on some nifty experience uplifting features that truly make a user go ‚Äúaha‚Äù. Missing that honestly for the last year or so. 6 Likes",

We also think keeping the OG spacefire colour is needed since that‚Äôs what we started with and that‚Äôs how our users remember us. In this case, would it be better to keep translucent skin instead? We wanted to keep this for special users. Community folks maybe? For example, gift box wraps. Some come in a faded translucent type with few patterns. But you can still see what‚Äôs underneath. Also, here‚Äôs a similar concept shared by @Aswin_Benny NFC enabled stickers for phones Features Jupiter should have this feature(Not sure if it can be implemented ) . A sticker that can be pasted anywhere like phones / watches, which has nfc support . My phone doesnt support tap and pay. If this was an option I would certainly buy the sticker.

Also, getting external credit card info also to one single Jupiter account could also help get the user gain a more insightful look at their assets and liabilities. 3 Likes",

    "question": "Need some clarifications on the updates",
    "answer": "RokkuRi (Someone) 26 November 2022 14:06 1 I signed up for Jupiter a while ago but was not able to use it properly, because I switched phone and kept getting the ‚Äúrooted phone‚Äù errors for a long time, which made it impossible to access the Jupiter account because there is no web app for it (which is a very bad idea, or is there a web app that I don‚Äôt know of?). I was finally able to log into the app properly today and I see that I need to maintain an NRV of Rs. 10,000 to get rewards (at another point it says I need a salary account). I had been maintaining less balance than that because I was not able to access Jupiter, but I had been using the card for small transactions. So after logging in I found out that I had not been getting rewards at all. I have no idea when this was put into place. Not just that, there is now a rs. 199 charge for debit card, and rewards are limited to salary account. How come I was not sent any kind of notification alerting me of this. I got stupid notifications about Nothing phone offer (on email and whatsapp) but not important notifications like this? So I got a few problems: Why is Jupiter introducing charges without any proper notifications? Why is Jupiter making it impossible to access our account if we don‚Äôt have a phone (or have a rooted phone)? In ‚ÄúAccount types‚Äù option I see there are two types of accounts - Savings and Salary. But in some places I see the term ‚ÄúPro‚Äù account being used which is not mentioned here. How do I get rewards and use free debit card without making this my salary account? What type of account does an NRV of rs. 10,000 upgrade my account to here? How do I close my account if I want to? I really liked Jupiter when I joined and was going to make use of it once it got out of the experimentation phase it seemed to be into an year ago, but all these unwelcome surprises are making me question it. 3 Likes",

    "question": "Why selling price of jupiter gold is lower than what is being displayed as invested value?",
    "answer": "Nav2024 (Naveen Kumar) 12 April 2024 12:58 1 It is understandable that we buy the digital gold with 3%gst. So there is variation in buying it. But why do the value decreases when we sell. For example if you buy 1G digi gold in jupiter for 6000 rupees with 3% gst (total u spent is 6180) the value invested is 6000rupees for 1 gram gold. Let‚Äôs say after 1 year now the app shows that ur invested value rouse up to 8000 but when you want sell. The value of ur investment will not be what they show (8000) rather it will be lower than that. Like 2-3% less. Why is it so? Could anyone explain why we are paying 2-3% again? Why can‚Äôt we get the actual value displayed? In my case - my invested value is showing as 60, 363.28 (which i bought after paying 3% gst) but if i want to sell it now, it only shows that i will receive 58,283.78 rupees. So, my question is where is the remaining 2079.50? Looks like am loosing again some money‚Ä¶ So what‚Äôs the use of jupiter digi gold purchase? Looks like a gimmick to me. What makes digi gold better if we r stil loosing money. Iam thinking buying gold coins and saving at home looks more profitable‚Ä¶ Any enlightenment is much appreciated‚Ä¶",

    "answer": "Rahul_Parmar (Rahul Parmar) 20 December 2023 09:59 1 I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I am currently facing with changing my phone number on the Jupiter app. When attempting to update my phone number, the app indicates that my desired number is already associated with another account. I suspect this may be the same number I tried to use when initially creating my account. Unfortunately, at that time, I encountered difficulties with Aadhar verification, preventing the successful creation of the account. Since then, I have successfully created an account using a different phone number. Previously, I had initiated the account opening process using a phone number that I could not complete due to Aadhar verification issues. Consequently, that previous account remains incomplete and half-baked. Now, as I am trying to switch my currently opened account‚Äôs phone number to that previous phone number which is linked with my bank accounts and Aadhaar card, the app indicates that my desired number is already associated with the incomplete KYC account which I did not open yet and now not even allowing me to proceed with the further with that account also. Could you kindly guide me on how to delete or resolve the half-baked account associated with my previous phone number? Your prompt assistance in addressing this matter would be highly appreciated.

    "question": "Account and Funds Accessibility Issues in Pots",
    "answer": "Devendra_Date (Devendra Date) 29 April 2024 04:47 1 Dear Jupiter App Product Managers On 15th April, I created financial pots within The Jupiter App and deposited an amount of money into it, assuming full functionality as my account was active at the time. However, upon attempting to close this pot and withdraw my funds, I was informed by the customer service team that my account had unexpectedly become ‚ÄúDormant‚Äù. I was further advised that reactivation of my account requires a physical visit to the nearest branch of Federal Bank Ltd to complete KYC verification procedures. This requirement is inconvenient, as the initial account setup and KYC were conducted online. The sudden necessity for an in-person visit, which contradicts the digital-first convenience promised by The Jupiter App, is not only frustrating but also impractical, given the current emphasis on digital solutions. Moreover, the explanation provided‚Äîthat the creation of the pot triggered the dormancy of my account‚Äîseems highly irregular and lacks transparency. This situation has led to my money being unjustly stuck without proper justification or prior warning. Therefore, I request a thorough investigation into this matter and ask for the following actions to be taken: A clear explanation of why my account was marked dormant after the pot creation and how it allowed me to deposit money in a ‚ÄúDormant‚Äù account. Immediate restoration of online KYC procedures to reactivate my account, ensuring access to my funds without unnecessary hurdles. Assurance of better customer support in handling such issues, preventing future occurrences for myself and other users. Please consider this matter with urgency, as it affects not only the accessibility of my funds but also the trust placed in The Jupiter App. I would appreciate a prompt response, detailing the steps you will take to resolve this issue. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. 3 Likes",

    "question": "\"Recent Transactions\" tab must also display the remaining balance after each transaction, not just the debit and credit amount (2)",
    "answer": "vijay45170 (V S Vijay) 13 March 2023 04:33 1 The idea is to include the remaining balance after each transaction, in smaller font just below each debit and credit amount, in the ‚ÄúRecent Transactions‚Äù tab. This solves the problem of not knowing how much money the user had/has before/after a transaction. It will be easy to track the money flow, if the change in balance or change in the base amount is displayed after every transaction. I always have to scroll down and make a particular transaction as a base point and compare it to my current bal. to see how much is the net expenditure after that base transaction. The idea of tags can be implemented, but the idea which I have suggested in my original argument, this feature is more fundamental and more like a must-have feture which already exists in many bank applications like YONO (by SBI), and ICICI Mobile, etc. Please find a screenshot attached below, to better understand my idea. Screenshot_20230313_100052_YONO SBI1080√ó2400 153 KB You can see that after each transaction, the balance is displayed on the bottom right of each transaction tile. This feature can make it‚Äôs way to Jupiter on the ‚ÄúAll Transactions‚Äù page which can be accessed by tapping on the ‚ÄúSee All‚Äù button present at the bottom of ‚ÄúRecent Transactions‚Äù drop down menu on Home Page. 9 Likes",

Some apps have good features. One of them is a better home Screen Widget. Currently the app only has a QR Scanner widget and nothing else and there is a lot of potential here. One that I would love to have is a wide networth Bar with a Aggregate Overview displayed. The app already has a networth indicator inside the it in the ‚ÄúMoney Tab => Networth‚Äù section If it was possible to have a financial overview dashboard widget, it would be amazing. And the app also has Multiple Bank Account Linking feature that shows all balances together. Even a simple 3√ó3 Table of [ Net Worth ] [ Received | Spend | Invested ] [ Accounts (s)Balance | Asset | Liability ] would be amazing. I can see how some people would not want to show actual financial numbers openly, so it could also have a option to disable Money Value and just have bars, graphs and arrows to indicate them. Even other stuff but I really think some better widgets could be great. 1 Like",

    "answer": "Tanvi_Agrawal (Tanvi Agrawal) 16 February 2023 06:33 1 Hi guys! Quick intro - I lead the debit card business at Jupiter and we are currently racking your brains to figure how to pack more goodness into the card! One of the things we are considering is: INSURANCE! Yes most cards in the market come with some kind of insurance but we want to make sure that we add something that is actually useful to the user. Now, if I were to ask folks which insurance they would like - the most common answer would be health insurance or mobile insurance! But honestly, these are QUITE expensive to be given as a free add-on To give you an idea, a decent health cover can cost more than 10-15k annually, depending on your age and type of coverage. But we still want to give you something that is actually beneficial to you and adds value to your financial and personal life! So how about hospitalization coverage against accidents? If you ever have any kind of accident and need hospitalisation due to that, your cost of medical treatment would be covered upto the sum insured. So you can have the peace of mind to not worry about sudden expenses and cash crunch in an emergency! The only caveat for availing this insurance is that you should have used your debit card at least once in the last 30 days. That‚Äôs all! Do hit one of the options below to let us know if you‚Äôd like this feature on your card and drop any other ideas/ thoughts in comments! Accidental Hospitalization Cover sounds useful to me I don‚Äôt need an Accidental Hospitalization Cover I don‚Äôt really know/ care 0 voters @trust_level_0 7 Likes Accident insurance on Jupiter 2023: The Year in Review",

Some questions: Where I can find all my failed transactions or all transactions including failed ones? Earlier I found some options for that but now I can‚Äôt seem to find unless I contact support. How does Jupiter provide direct mutual funds as they are not charging anything separately for it? And here are some suggestions: Add option to check the total balance including the fund blocked for IPO or Retail Direct through UPI ASBA. Currently it only shows the Effective Balance (The balance I can spend). Show the amount in the foreign currency too for international transactions in transaction details. Currently it only shows the amount in INR. But you may wonder why would someone need it! Actually some service providers use it as verifying the identity if you get locked out of your account and loose access to the email, thet charge some random amount and ask to provide the value.",

Option to change profile or account holder photo When I opened account in jupiter, they used photo from my aadhar which was very old of me for profile photo. There is no option to change it. someone may thinking is it much important. It will be a great issue if someone has to submit digital passbook for official purposes. 2. Option to rename pot name and add notes I use lot the Pot feature in jupiter. It is a great feature for me. But sometimes when I have to change plan while saving, I have withdraw amount or destroy pot and create anoter pot for it. There isn‚Äôt any option to rename the existing pot. Also the option for adding simple note for each pot will be helpful especially when someone has more pots. It will be helpful to add notes about saving plan. 3. Option to pay bills even after due date This month when tried to pay electricity bill in which its due date passed, it says ‚Äúyou cannot pay this bill anymore because it is past due date‚Äù. While other payment apps including paytm, amazon pay, g pay allow users to pay bills even after due date, why not in Jupiter? I hope jupiter team will take good steps and make this features available soon 6 Likes",

EMI schemes allow customers to pay for the product over an extended period of time, rather than paying the full amount upfront. However, this convenience can also lead to impulsive buying behavior, where customers make purchases without fully considering the financial impact of the EMI payments. Participants in the thread share their personal experiences with EMI schemes and impulsive buying behaviour and provide tips for avoiding impulsive purchases. The discussion highlights the need for customers to be mindful of their spending habits and to make informed decisions when considering EMI schemes. What is EMI? To attract more customers and increase sales, merchant outlets and credit card companies in India offer Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) payment schemes. This is particularly helpful for customers who may not have the immediate funds to make a purchase but can afford to pay in instalments over a period of time. EMI is a popular payment option for electronic appliances, mobiles, laptops, and other gadgets, where customers can buy the product and start using it immediately while paying for it in smaller instalments spread over a longer duration. EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is a fixed amount of money that a borrower pays to a lender on a monthly basis, usually for a loan or credit card payment. The EMI includes both the principal amount and the interest charged on the loan. EMI is commonly used for payments related to loans for personal expenses, education, vehicles, homes, and other assets. What is Impulsive Buying? Impulsive buying is the act of making a purchase without prior planning or consideration, often based on emotions, desires, or immediate needs rather than careful evaluation of the product or service. Impulsive buyers tend to make quick purchasing decisions without fully considering the long-term consequences or benefits of the purchase. This behavior is often driven by factors such as advertisements, peer pressure, discounts, and emotions like excitement or stress. Impulsive buying can lead to overspending, financial stress, and buyer‚Äôs remorse, particularly when the purchased item turns out to be unnecessary or of low quality. So here are some of the questions for the community friends: Have you ever made a purchase using an EMI scheme? If so, What was the first product you purchased on EMI? Which EMI plan do you prefer the most (3 months, 6 months etc etc‚Ä¶24 months)? Have you ever faced any difficulties after purchasing for friends or family members using EMI? (like missed payments:rofl:) In your opinion, does the availability of EMI options lead to impulsive buying behaviour?

    "question": "Loan Errors: Navigating a Financial Maze: Challenges Faced with Flipkart's EMI and IDFC First Bank. Are they scamming us?",
    "answer": "umar (Umar Khan) 23 November 2023 18:28 1 Hello All! On 8th October 2023, I made a purchase of an MSI Core i3 11th Gen laptop through Flipkart and opted for the ‚ÄúFlipkart Pay Later EMI‚Äù service with IDFC First Bank as the lending partner, which was loan 1. Additionally, on 11th October 2023, I purchased a TWS in EMI of 1750 for 3 months, making the total cost to be paid 4999 along with a loan processing fee of 116, which was loan 2. As per the terms of loan 1, I was supposed to pay a total amount of 26597 in 6 installments of 4749, along with a loan processing fee of 471. However, I decided to prepay the entire outstanding loan amount of loan 1 on 18th October 2023, with a foreclosure fee of 1063.88, resulting in a total payment of 27891.45 made to IDFC First Bank before the billing date of EMIs of 1 November 2023. If I had not opted for foreclosure of loan 1, then my total EMI would have been 7086 for the first month, which includes the EMIs & processing fees of both loan 1 and loan 2 and 6499 for the subsequent months. Once the EMIs of loan 2 were completed, I would have had to pay 4749. However, since I have already paid the entire loan amount of loan 1, I did not need to pay anything for loan 1. Therefore, my current EMI should be 1816 for the 1st month, which includes only the EMI of loan 2 and the loan processing fee of 116, and 1750 for the subsequent months. However, I am facing an issue where the EMI amount of 8151.88 appeared in my statement for November 2023, generated on 2nd November 2023, despite the prepayment and the issuance of a No Dues Certificate by IDFC First Bank confirming the clearance of all dues of loan 1. They also added the foreclosure amount to my statement, which I had already paid. This discrepancy is causing confusion and inconvenience as the EMI amount should not be reflected in my statement after the full prepayment. I am concerned that I might be charged for a payment I have already settled. Additionally, my Pay Later account has been suspended by Flipkart due to non-payment, as stated in an SMS from Flipkart, not the bank. However, I have made the EMI payment for the loan through the bank‚Äôs app, along with the loan processing fees for both accounts. On 2 November, I reached out to the customer support teams of both Flipkart and IDFC First Bank. The bank informed me that they have closed the loan account on their end and provided me with a No Dues Certificate. However, when I contacted Flipkart, they advised me to contact the bank, even though I had already done so and the bank had cleared their name from the issue this goes on at least 10 times in 1 day. The problem lies with Flipkart, as they have not processed the amount from their side and it still appears on my statement. I have already gone through two stages of complaint, first with customer care and then with the grievance officer, providing all the necessary evidence. Unfortunately, no resolution has been reached thus far. Now, I am considering escalating my complaint to the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) via the RBI Ombudsman. I am requesting the RBI to rectify this error and provide compensation for the mental distress I have experienced. Please advise me on the next steps I should take, or if you have any other suggestions, kindly let me know. 1 Like",

    "question": "NFC-Payments through our phones",
    "answer": "RSSM (Kitten) 24 May 2022 16:43 1 Hey, So today I was at INOX and realized that I had left my Jupiter card at home. I asked them if I could UPI but they refused and told me that they don‚Äôt accept it. (Ended up paying with a credit card sigh) So it got me thinking. What about making it so we can pay with our cards through NFC directly via the Jupiter app or add it onto apps like Samsung Pay or Google pay? And still get cashback or not, Cashback doesn‚Äôt matter to me atleast. image696√ó392 46.4 KB FAQ Why not pay via UPI? My response: Some stores don‚Äôt accept it. (Especially here in Kolkata) Go back and bring our card? My response: Some times we may forget or loose them and especially when you are in a situation where you are purchasing food or clothes and realize that you cannot go back and bring them/ or wait for a new card to come. And since I‚Äôm travelling I cant even get a card, since I‚Äôm not home. We carry our phones all the time, but not our wallets. Use Cash? My response: If we don‚Äôt have our cards, we cannot withdraw cash. How does this work? My response: It is the same technology on our cards called NFC. It comes on all modern phones now a days. Safety-ness of this? My response: I guess this one matters on you, Jupiter allows us to turn on/off Contactless payments so maybe use that as a safeguard? Anyways there is a lock on financial apps like Jupiter/Gpay/Samsung pay so its pretty safe and Gpay even makes a different card number so your number is never leaked. (test it out, it works), Much safer than a card that just requires a tap to make payments without any pin. How many banks have these? My response: Many have it, like kotak, axis, icici, Federal bank (only on the Gpay app) and so on‚Ä¶ Even OneCard the co-branded credit card has it (Gpay). You said Federal Bank is supported on Gpay so why cant we use our Jupiter cards on it? My response: Only certain Bins are given to Gpay by Federal Bank and Jupiter‚Äôs bin is not on it that is why. (what is a bin? Bank Identification Number (Bin) is the first 4-6 numbers on a payment card that identifies the card issuer. The first digit is the major industry identifier, and the remaining digits communicate the financial institution that issued the card.) (What is your bin? Check it here https://binlist.net) Reply with a question and ill reply. This whole thing is a petition/suggestion btw. Forgive any mistakes in my post. The Jupiter Iphone app image is just for illustration on how I want to see the app, I havent put much effort into it.

    "question": "Offers and Rewards Section",
    "answer": "SPOFFICEAL (SP) 19 February 2025 17:25 1 Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how Jupiter could improve its UPI app experience, focusing on dedicated offers and cashback, and how to frame these suggestions as requests to Jupiter: I. Enhancing Offers and Cashback within Jupiter UPI Dedicated ‚ÄúOffers & Rewards‚Äù Section: Instead of burying offers within transaction history or relying on push notifications, create a prominent ‚ÄúOffers & Rewards‚Äù section within the UPI app. This section should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and clearly categorize offers. Personalized Offers: Leverage Jupiter‚Äôs data analysis to provide personalized offers based on user transaction patterns. For example: Frequent grocery shoppers get cashback on supermarket UPI transactions. Users who often pay for food delivery get discounts on partner restaurants. Utilize user location data to provide local merchant offers. Tiered Cashback/Rewards System: Implement a tiered system where users earn more rewards based on their UPI transaction volume or frequency. This could include: Base cashback on all UPI transactions. Bonus cashback for hitting monthly transaction goals. Exclusive offers for high-volume users. Partner Merchant Offers: Forge partnerships with popular online and offline merchants to offer exclusive UPI cashback and discounts. Promote these partnerships prominently within the ‚ÄúOffers & Rewards‚Äù section. Gamification: Introduce gamified elements like: ‚ÄúStreaks‚Äù for consecutive daily UPI transactions. ‚ÄúChallenges‚Äù to earn bonus rewards. ‚ÄúSpin the wheel‚Äù or scratch card options for random rewards. Clear and Transparent Cashback Tracking: Provide a clear and real-time view of earned cashback and rewards within the app. Ensure easy redemption of cashback to the user‚Äôs Jupiter account. Inform the user of expiring offer and cashback. II. Framing Requests to Jupiter Here‚Äôs how you can phrase your suggestions as constructive requests to Jupiter: Subject: Enhancing Jupiter UPI with a Dedicated Offers & Rewards Section Body: ‚ÄúDear Jupiter Team, I‚Äôm a loyal Jupiter user and I appreciate the convenience of your UPI feature. To further enhance the user experience, I‚Äôd like to suggest the implementation of a dedicated ‚ÄòOffers & Rewards‚Äô section within the Jupiter UPI app.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis section could feature personalized offers, partner merchant discounts, and a tiered cashback system, making it more engaging for users.‚Äù ‚ÄúSpecifically, I would like to request that you consider the following:‚Äù ‚ÄúCreating a visually appealing ‚ÄòOffers & Rewards‚Äô tab.‚Äù ‚ÄúImplementing personalized offers based on transaction history and location.‚Äù ‚ÄúDeveloping a tiered cashback system to incentivize frequent UPI usage.‚Äù ‚ÄúPartnering with popular merchants to provide exclusive UPI offers.‚Äù ‚ÄúAdding gamification elements to make rewards more engaging.‚Äù ‚ÄúProviding clear and transparent cashback tracking and redemption.‚Äù ‚ÄúAdding a system that notifies users of expiring offers and cashback.‚Äù ‚ÄúI believe these improvements would significantly increase user engagement and make Jupiter UPI an even more valuable tool. Thank you for your consideration.‚Äù 1 Like",

    "answer": "VISHAL.VODRO (VISHAL VODRO) 16 June 2022 09:46 1 If you did not know, you can access Jupiter/Fi-Money Account using Federal Bank‚Äôs website/netbanking portal. Login / SignUP After you Register/Login, you‚Äôd find your Jupiter Account is listed there in the Account section. After a week or so, you‚Äôd find if you have any other Account like Fi-Money too listed there automatically. And one more additional Account would be there as well. After reviewing in detail, I found out that the extra Account is of Jupiter‚Äôs POT Account, where separate money being kept for Accounting. In short if you have Jupiter Account, then you are eventually holding 2 Accounts of the same Bank. One is the Normal Jupiter Account and another is the POT Account. And both Account Numbers are different as it‚Äôs supposed to be‚Ä¶ In my case, I am having total 3 Accounts of Federal Bank. Jupiter. Jupiter POT. Fi Money. Good initiative indeed! 2 Likes",

But the issue is with the vkyc after completing the vkyc agent told check it after 5 mins it will get reviewed in 5 mins and even i got the notification that Account is ready for the use but but but Is still showing that review page. I know you may get a huge response but half of the application is getting waitlisted and half of the application get the option to complete the kyc but you guyz are not verifying it I just don‚Äôt know what is wrong at your end. Few user application is verified and they are using it as well. but what about us who is waiting from the month of august? Almost 10 months. If someone is reading this post from Jupiter Edge team request you to kindly verify all the application or reject all applications if you can‚Äôt verify. I know the holiday is started and now We have to wait 1-2 weeks more. Signing off, Carolin 1 Like",

But the whole Jupiter app is intuitive that‚Äôs what impressing me. So further coming back to feedback , in depositing money in pots have only one option by transferring money from Jupiter account to pot, right ? . Why don‚Äôt you allow us to deposit money to Pot using different payment method? Maybe other bank debit card, credit card, UPI. Ok I do understand there maybe charges for these kind of payment gateway but if you mention the charges and give option to customers. It will be awesome thank you 2 Likes",

    "answer": "Surojit_Ghosh (Surojit Ghosh) 11 April 2023 04:10 1 I have a request to the Jupiter team.I have already made this request before from their help section but the problem is not resolved. Now the problem is that the mobile number I am using is in jupiter is my mother‚Äôs number.I joined jupiter in May 2022 since then I am using jupiter on my mother‚Äôs number but now I have to return my mother‚Äôs number. Now the thing is that I want to transfer my jupiter account to this number which I am currently using. Previous year I have logged in Jupiter with my current number casually but I have not opened any account when I have logged into jupiter with this number before. So whenever i try to change my number it shows‚Äô this number is already linked with another account‚Äô. A few days ago when I contacted the support team finally after much discussion they replied me that this number is binding with their server so they can‚Äôt help me.Now I request them to look into this device binding issue.Then I can change my mobile number. Otherwise maybe i have to close my account. @Shawnpinto 1 Like",

    "answer": "Ray_Sar (Ray Sar) 28 April 2025 05:49 1 Hi team, I am using Jupiter Money since two years and I like the Idea it‚Äôs built upon. But If I consider Jupiter as a sole UPI app then I hate to admit that It‚Äôs totally laggy with outdated and clumpy UI as compared to other UPI apps. So, it‚Äôs difficult to use as daily basis UPI app. My suggestions: Simplify app UI. Give an option to edit UPI id. Decrease font Size in the app. Home section should be options for Pay to mobile, Transfer, Balance check, History. Invest section should be clutter free. Loan section is good bdw. Upi lite. 4 Likes",

Now that I know one thing that there is no way for you guys to identify an account holder other than using his phone number which questions on why I should trust my pot funds to someone who doesn‚Äôt have a proper way to authenticate a customer even when biometrics and video verifications and lots are available. I had got my phone stolen on Dec 13 and along with it, I lost my sim which was registered under my sister‚Äôs name and she is abroad right now. So I couldn‚Äôt get a duplicate of it. I went to the nearest federal Bank and updated my phone number over there and I had filled the email address registered on the form. They said I‚Äôd get access to Jupiter in 24hrs. Now that I am trying to login to my Jupiter, it shows a message that ‚Äúthe email is address is registered to another number (old number)‚Äù. I reached out to your customer support via call and chat number of times which I found to be a complete waste of time and energy. I had no issue with updating phone number at Kotak Mahindra which is my salary account. Why do you guys have no way of verifying an existing user other than phone number? I even got my Pan card and aadhar updated while you guys still have trouble sorting my issue out. Not even a ticket numbe was raised even after reaching out so many times. How can I trust someone like you when I have my savings pot stuck inside it? Is there no way for your system to authenticate an existing customer other than using phone number? Wow‚Ä¶ explains a great lot of security in keeping the money inside the account, heh!",

Kudos to @Jiten and his team for improving the customer experience. Now for some suggestions to further improve the customer support experience- 1)Please mail the transcript of the communication exchange to the customer on his email as well, that will help him to keep track and remember as well incase he clear his notifications. 2)Do also include displaying a message like typing‚Ä¶ or some symbol when either the support staff or the customer is typing. I hope to see these changes implemented soon as this will not just enhance an already beautiful experience but also will be more intuitive to the final consumer and will in the process keep him alert and patient as well.

When I add my mobile number, it says Mobile number update initiated. And I cannot move forward from here. I got in touch with customer support and after a few discussions, they got to know the issue. The phone number I used for onboarding was associated with a different customer‚Äôs account in their system. And due to company policy, they‚Äôre unable to delete or modify this data from their database. I recently got a new phone number and linked it with my Aadhaar & PAN. I also have a federal account with this new number. But I cannot for some reason create a Jupiter account because some X customer had used my new number previously. Now I cannot onboard Jupiter because of the said issue. The customer support says I can onboard if I get a new sim and gets it linked to my Aadhaar/PAN and that‚Äôs a long, hectic process which I do not want to go through. Please allow users to create an account with any number as long as it‚Äôs linked with their Aadhar and PAN. Follow the same while they change their number. This is a very lame issue and we should fix it. Any help is welcome. 3 Likes",

    "answer": "KashtSeMar (Aravind Pai) 11 May 2024 04:56 1 Jupiter recently announced so-called Switch in credit card with much hullabaloo. At the same time, in collusion with Federal Bank, they quietly started a bait and switch scam. See Bait-and-switch - Wikipedia At the time of opening the savings account, it was told to be a zero balance account. There was no account closure charges if done within 14 days, or after 6 months. Now Federal Bank has sent out an email saying the zero balance will be removed, and moreover, there is no option to close the account without paying service charge! It has been 10 days since that mail from Federal Bank, but no communication from Jupiter clearly showing they are complicit in this scam. I understand the company is under pressure to start raking in the moolah to show the numbers to the investors, but taking this route of scamming customers cannot be accepted. Hence, please restore the original terms and conditions immediately, or provide an option to close the account without charges. 4 Likes",

    "answer": "razack (ABDUL RAZACK K P) 28 November 2023 14:26 1 Yesterday, the statement for the CSB Edge RuPay Card was generated, with a total monthly spend of 4,046. During this period, earned 810 jewels valued at 162 Rs as rewards, receiving 4% rewards on all three transactions. The statement is pretty neat and clean At present, there are three ways to redeem the jewels: Converting to Cash balance Conversion to Digital Gold and the latest addition: Conversion to Gift Cards However, it‚Äôd be far more convenient if users could utilize those jewels to offset the total outstanding amount. This could be similar to OneCard‚Äôs option, where one can strike off a particular transaction if there are enough points, or similar to BOB‚Äôs method of automatically converting points to cash and adjusting it against the outstanding bill during statement generation. @Lizann_Fernandez 11 Likes 2023: The Year in Review",

This could be the update you‚Äôve been waiting for We saw a bunch of you participating in the Quest for Metal After we announced the winners, people (a lot of them) had just one question for us ‚Äî how and when they could get their Metal Debit Card Some of you also had ideas about setting criteria for who gets the Metal Card - Higher NRV, MAB, fees, etc. Link So here‚Äôs the update ‚Äî while the card will continue to be limited, we want to ensure more of you get your hands on it. Interested? Let us know how much you would like to pay for the metal card and what you expect from it. I‚Äôll go first - I would be okay to pay a one time cost that covers the issuance of a metal card and would expect it to be the shiniest piece of metal with me. What are your thoughts?

On January 25, 2024, at 12:13 pm, I received an email from Jupiter stating that an amount of 7000 had been withdrawn from the pot. But the thing is I havent done the withdrawal. Everything would have been fine if that amount had been credited to my account, but unfortunately, it hasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not even recorded in the account transactions; the statement indicating the withdrawal is only in my pots statement, and it doesn‚Äôt appear in the account statement or the Federal bank statement either. The frustration doesn‚Äôt end there; today, a friend transferred 6000 via Cred. While Cred shows that the amount has been received in my account, it hasn‚Äôt been credited. 1 Like",

    "question": "Chaos Theory & Financial Services | Part 2: Banking Returns",
    "answer": "aniket (Aniket Tamboli) 17 August 2020 18:30 1 Originally published at: Chaos Theory & Financial Services | Part 2: Banking Returns > Jupiter In Part 1 of this blog series (which you should read because it‚Äôs awesome‚Ä¶and because it sets the stage for this one), I laid out how the densely packed banking singularity erupted in an explosion of financial services over the 2010s, i.e., the Birth of Fintech. This chaotic upheaval of financial services spawned a bunch of specialised products for everything from payments to investments. And while these products, by virtue of their focus, were superior to their traditional counterparts, the overall experience (as far as our financial lives go) was still disparate, confusing, and ultimately not as beneficial as we‚Äôd hoped. Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì this unbundling was important. We owe it everything. Much like we owe our existence to the Big Bang and the billions of years of chaos that followed. But much like the Big Bang, we are now at an inevitable point in time ‚Äì when the chaos has lasted long enough that we‚Äôre beginning to see moments of order within it. Welcome to the world of self-organized fintech. Welcome to Neobanking. The theory of all things money The fintech services from the decade gone by have done us a ton of good. We have slick payment apps whose rewards are like little kicks of dopamine; lending apps that have made small credit lines so much more accessible; and even trading/investment services that cut out the middleman while also giving you a beautiful UI to DIY! But for all the success these services had in improving the experience of a single thing, they largely failed to generate enough interest to change how seriously us 20-somethings took our financial lives and security. And the reason appears to be simple ‚Äì too many disparate apps that really don‚Äôt make managing our financial life any easier. Imagine a service that not only tracks how much money you‚Äôre making and spending every month, but can kick up your investments if you have a little extra coming in these days. Think of an app that can take a look at your savings accounts and the projected returns from your investments to tell you if it‚Äôs a good idea to get a loan for that new car or bike right now. Picture a single, unified service that is able to take into account your goals and your finances ‚Äì all to help you make better financial decisions. Day after day. Month after month. That level of decision-making is only possible with a holistic view of your money. And the ability to make decisions based on such a holistic view is what has always set the financially savvy apart. If chaos is beautiful, order is helpful Look, I‚Äôm not one to bite the hand that enables you. Whether it‚Äôs the e-wallets, UPI apps, easy credit lines or mutual fund apps ‚Äì focused fintech products have not only set the tone for what financial services should look like in the future, but more importantly, set expectations about their experience in our‚Äîthe consumer‚Äôs‚Äîminds. But as these services evolved, so did our 20-something minds and needs ‚Äì from the let‚Äôs-wing-it-neanderthal to the think-it-through-sapiens stage. We are increasingly looking to either clean up our financial lives (if you‚Äôre fortunate enough to have one) or seriously get started on building one (if you‚Äôre an ignorant fool like I am). And what we need in this situation isn‚Äôt more products ‚Äì what we need is help. That‚Äôs why the ‚Äúbetter way to do X with your money‚Äù services from the decade gone by are now, slowly yet steadily, giving rise to ‚Äúimprove the experience of N things for your money.‚Äù The purpose? Firstly, to help us make sense of everything that‚Äôs at our disposal; and then, to help us make better use of it all through contextual, data-backed suggestions. In it for the long, wide run The rise of such services will be far more significant than just having a good-looking new app on our phones ‚Äì it will mark the arrival of new-age 360¬∫ financial partners, much like the banks of yore, that will stick with you through your various, changing needs. As you go from needing small credit lines that ease month-end woes, to thinking of more serious loans for bigger things in life, these services will help you make better decisions instead of leaving it to you to figure out the best course of action. They will understand that as your life and needs change, so does the importance of everything from investments to savings. And they will use this knowledge to channel your money",

    "question": "A retail investor's tryst with the markets - Part 1",
    "answer": "Angana_S (Angana Sripur) 8 September 2020 18:30 1 Originally published at: A retail investor's tryst with the markets - Part 1 > Jupiter Back in 1850, a group of five stockbrokers used to conduct brokerage meetings under a banyan tree in front of Mumbai‚Äôs town hall. This small group moved to Dalal Street in 1874 (Dalal means broker in many regional languages), giving birth to the iconic Bombay Stock Exchange. While the concept of investing has been around since the 1800s, the stock market remained unfamiliar territory to most people in India, until some liberalization reforms, digitization, and stock market frauds were thrown into the mix. As people marvel over the unexpected market rally in the midst of a pandemic, we thought it‚Äôs worth taking a look at how the retail investor has traversed the turbulent path of risk and reward. This story is almost as intriguing as the one in Gangs of Wasseypur (and just like the movie, it has two parts). Sowing the seeds of a socialist doctrine Reeling from the hangover of the colonial era, trade, and commerce in the 1950s and 60s was mostly controlled by state-owned institutions. This setup was a way for the government to mobilize funds through banks. However, it also aimed at reducing monopoly and providing fair credit access to people. This bid to control citizens‚Äô economic lives meant that for most people ‚Äòsaving‚Äô was synonymous with instruments such as bank FDs. Bank facilities were thinly spread and other avenues of wealth-creation such as the stock market was mostly a closed-door one that involved steep fees and waiting for weeks until the paperwork arrived. It wasn‚Äôt until 1963 that the idea of ‚ÄòMutual funds‚Äô was introduced to the public. The RBI set up the Unit Trust of India (UTI), an incentive to get people interested in retail investment. But most people still stuck to their first love- Fixed Deposits (This wouldn‚Äôt change for a few decades, but we‚Äôll get to that in a bit). The age of the equity emperor Before we hit the late 70s, India had started to grapple with a new challenge: the unforeseen effects of the License Raj. The bureaucratic nature of this system stifled fundraising, hampering private businesses, and restricting innovation. This led to the country evidencing a ‚ÄòHindu rate of growth‚Äô, the low growth rate which was in sharp contrast to our Asian counterparts with similar incomes. Now during the license raj, there was one man who was still establishing huge industries- Dhirubhai Ambani aka the ‚ÄòEquity emperor‚Äô. And here‚Äôs what he wanted to do: he wanted to convince the common man to invest in his dreams. To lure him away from just saving to investing he turned to convertible debentures issues. A convertible debenture (CD) is a kind of long-term loan which can be transformed into a company‚Äôs stock after a specific period of time. CDs were a win-win from the word go. They allowed industrialists to raise capital for their ambitions directly from retail investors, bypassing banks that insisted on securing loans through project assets and promoter guarantees. At the same time, they provided retail investors a higher rate of interest than bank fixed deposits, while also giving holders potential kicker in the form of additional returns through appreciation on the conversion of debentures into equity. Those who invested in the Reliance Industries Ltd CDs became millionaires as they stayed invested, fuelling the appetite and aspirations of others. A small portion of the population finally started getting a taste of what wealth creation beyond bank FDs looked like. Rising from the ashes By the summer of 1991, India was a high-cost economy at the brink of collapse. Millions watched in anticipation as a seemingly timid man was to make a televised announcement to the people; Manmohan Singh began this address with a fitting Urdu composition that read ‚Äòthe desire for revolution is in our hearts‚Äô. This was the introduction of liberalization reforms. The intent of these reforms was clear: the government was keen to dismantle socialistic doctrines in the pursuit of a free-market economy. It encouraged the industry to raise capital from the open market and the government would go from being a controller to a regulator. The markets reacted well, and the reforms evoked a decade of renewed growth and expansion. However, the birth of this new economic charter began with a rather dubious transition- the Harshad Mehta securities scam. You must have heard of this story as some sort ",

    "question": "How gold and gilt funds can help you hedge market bets",
    "answer": "aniket (Aniket Tamboli) 11 May 2020 18:30 1 Originally published at: How gold and gilt funds can help you hedge market bets > Jupiter What do you think about when you hear the word ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù? Stocks? SIPs? Equity mutual funds? All of us flock to these instruments with visions of supplementary income, building a retirement plan, or even achieving financial independence (a.k.a ‚Äúseeing the world‚Äù or ‚Äúopening my own microbrewery‚Äù). However ‚Äì these instruments depend heavily on the market‚Äôs performance. And while their returns look promising, they can swing unexpectedly between ‚Äòexciting‚Äô and ‚Äòworrying‚Äô. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to also invest in more stable and safer items ‚Äì instruments that aren‚Äôt as dependent on the market, but still hold great value in your portfolio. Instruments that have a low correlation to the market‚Äôs performance. Welcome to the world of Low Correlation Assets ‚Äì we‚Äôre talking about government-issued bonds, cold gold, and even hard cash. (Account balance works too; we‚Äôre not picky about cash-stuffed mattresses). These assets don‚Äôt always boast super-high, inflation-beating returns. But during times of economic uncertainties (like right now), they are the ones that remain largely stable. Shouldn‚Äôt my investment mantra be ‚Äúgrowth, growth, growth‚Äù? Yes and no. While your idea of investing is growing your wealth and consistently reaping positive returns ‚Äì it‚Äôs the market that gets to crush or lift your dreams between 9:15 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. every day. The Rs. 1,000 you invested today could become Rs. 1,200 tomorrow; which could fall to Rs. 800 the day after. Consider the recent, sudden fall in the markets. It shows us how delicate investment returns can be in the face of recession and black swan events. Some of us are even witnessing a complete wipe-out of investment gains made in mutual funds over the past 3 years. Ouch! But it‚Äôs exactly during these times that low-correlation assets shine bright ‚Äì they help soften such blows by serving as a safe-guard against drastic depletion of wealth during falling markets. That‚Äôs why, it‚Äôs okay to have gold locked away in a bank locker or have cash stashed away in mattresses and pillows. As long as the IT department knows about it, you‚Äôre probably doing yourself a favour. Sooo, I should just go out and buy gold? Again, yes‚Ä¶and no. There are more options. Take Gilt Funds for instance. These are funds that invest only in debt that‚Äôs backed by a sovereign (government) guarantee. They are issued by the RBI on behalf of the government and do not invest in corporate bonds. Which means their value doesn‚Äôt depend on corporations being able to pay their debts. No points for guessing why they‚Äôre so stable. Fact is, we undervalue such assets when the markets are doing well, because their returns pale in comparison to market-linked instruments. If you‚Äôve followed gilt funds or even gold prices over the past few years, you may feel like they have underperformed and not delivered the returns you‚Äôd want from a typical ‚Äúinvestment.‚Äù But look at any graph now and it‚Äôs clear that they are doing better than market-related investments. ![](upload://lp7EyDGadSCJAfROQa6SFb7e8cL.png)In the above chart (spanning 5 years), you can see that the HDFC Gold Fund has surged every time the equity markets have corrected. But when the equity market was surging, the HDFC Gold fund showed a more benign (stable) performance. Then there‚Äôs the HDFC Gilt fund ‚Äì which not only shows returns that are safe and steady, but a better-than-inflation return even at its worst point of entry! And that‚Äôs what makes it worth slotting such assets into your portfolio ‚Äì you‚Äôre relatively covered against the impact of a recession or unforeseen market falls. GILT‚Ä¶FUND‚Ä¶EVERYTHING! No! No! It‚Äôs all about balance. Talk to your financial advisor to work out how you should split your investments between risky, relatively safe and super-safe low-correlation assets. And while we can‚Äôt give you a broad suggestion for the first two, we can advise making gilt funds and gold a part of your investments. They have the advantage of not being as connected to the markets, and are thus more stable. Of course, you can also include such assets outside of your ‚Äòinvestment portfolio‚Äô. Think back to our first blog about building an emergency fund. You could hold this entire amount (worth ~6 months of your salary or 10% of your portfolio, whichever is higher) purely in the form of low-correlation assets! Yes, introducing such assets int",

    "answer": "keeithvz (Keith) 11 April 2025 05:34 1 It would be great to have some kind of quick access to 2-3 pots of my choice either on the home screen or on the pots page. The way I use pots is that I deposit money very frequently into some of them but the issue is that the pots I deposit into are buried deep into ‚ÄúView all‚Äù list. It gets mentally exhausting to have to go through a total of 3 clicks, the added cognitive load and distractions along the way to just add 200Rs to a pot. It would make my life a lot easier if I had access to some of my pots that I could either favorite or pin, either in the home screen or at the pots page to help with this. Another idea could also be widgets in iOS to allow for quick access to the pots of our choice. Or even the long press on an icon. Some kind of quick access is all I‚Äôm asking for. What if Jupiter just gave different parts of the app quick access to the user based on their personal needs and niche usages. Make them all quick-accessible in some way. For me it‚Äôs pots for someone else it could be gold. Who knows. All in all I think Jupiter has reached a mature stage in design and it‚Äôs time to focus on some nifty experience uplifting features that truly make a user go ‚Äúaha‚Äù.

    "question": "Super.Money SuperCard Experience",
    "answer": "Siddharth_B_R (Siddharth B R) 19 November 2024 09:27 1 Hi, wanted to know the best secured credit cards available in the market right now. As per my research, SuperCard launched by Super.Money and Utkarsh SFB is the best option. The rewards can be redeemed instantly. The min. rewards withdrawal amount is ‚Çπ10. The app has a clean and simple UI as well. SuperCard Pros and Cons Pros Low FD Requirement: Minimum FD starts at just ‚Çπ100, making it highly accessible. Free Physical Card for Higher FD: If the FD is ‚Çπ5,000 or more, the physical card is provided free of cost. Adjustable Credit Limit: Users can increase or decrease their credit limit by creating or withdrawing additional FDs. Flexibility to manage limits based on your needs. Contactless Pay Feature: Offers the convenience of tap-to-pay for small transactions. Cashback Rewards: Unlimited up to 5% cashback on Super Money UPI transactions using the card. 0.5% cashback on all non-UPI transactions (capped at ‚Çπ200/month). Enhanced cashback for specific merchants: 5% on Myntra. 3% on ClearTrip. 2% on Flipkart (max cashback ‚Çπ500/month). 8% FD Interest: Your FD earns interest while securing the card. No Annual or Joining Fee for Virtual Card: Free to use if you stick to the virtual version. Credit Score Building: Reports to credit bureaus like CIBIL, helping establish or improve your credit history. No Income Proof Required: Approval is based solely on FD creation. User-Friendly App: Easy tracking of rewards, payments, and cashback through the Super.Money app. Cons FD Balance Restriction: For FDs of ‚Çπ5,000 or more, the FD balance must remain at or above ‚Çπ5,000 for 12 months. A fee of ‚Çπ299 is charged for the card they have issued if the balance drops below this threshold. Physical Card Fee for Smaller FDs: If the FD is less than ‚Çπ5,000, the physical card incurs a fee of ‚Çπ299. Limited Rewards for Non-UPI Spends: Cashback rewards are capped for non-UPI transactions, making it less attractive for high spenders. No rewards for government-related transactions, wallet reloads, or certain categories. High Interest on Outstanding Balances: 3% per month (36% annually) interest rate if the full payment isn‚Äôt made by the due date. No Fuel Surcharge Waiver: Not ideal for users who frequently buy fuel with a credit card. Limited Credit Limit: Credit limit capped at 90% of FD value, which might be low for users needing higher limits. If all FDs are withdrawn, the card will be automatically closed. Standing Instructions Not Allowed: No option to set up auto-pay for bill payments, which could lead to missed due dates. Is It Worth It? For Beginners: Perfect for first-time credit card users or those building their credit score. For Online Shoppers: Highly rewarding for users shopping on Myntra, Flipkart, or ClearTrip and using Super Money UPI. For Advanced Users: May feel restrictive due to low credit limits and lack of premium perks. If you join using my invite link and make UPI transaction, you get additional cashback.

This approach may not be effective, as analytics likely indicate that people struggle to recall arbitrary numbers. Typically, individuals remember numbers that hold personal significance, but they may be hesitant to share these with strangers via UPI. To address this, I propose enabling users to create customized UPI IDs using alphanumeric or alphabet-based formats. This would improve memorability and enhance privacy. 2 Likes",

    "question": "10 Best Ways to Save Money | Jupiter",
    "answer": "JupiterTeam (Jupiter Team) 15 September 2021 16:55 1 Life is uncertain, and the COVID-19 pandemic has given a reality check to the entire world. Millions of people across the globe have lost their jobs and faced medical emergencies, leaving them with huge debt and monetary constraints. Financial challenges can significantly increase your stress levels. Therefore, saving for the future is important than ever. Being in charge of your spending habits and savings can help prevent distress. So, here are some of the best ways to save money. 10 best ways to save money Wondering how to save money? Well, it is an art mastered by a few. One common excuse most people give for not saving is that their salaries are low. However, saving even 10% of your salary each month can add to your overall financial stability in the long term. Budget your money Determining a budget is one of the most important things to follow. Prepare a monthly budget and adhere to it. Although it may seem cumbersome, it is one of the best ways to save money. The budget allows you to keep track of your expenses and avoid unnecessary expenditures. The money saved can then be invested to build wealth. Save money through health insurance You may wonder how to save money from salary by purchasing a health insurance plan. However, it is possible when you pay an annual premium. It is beneficial to pay the premium rather than spend a huge amount due to an accident or sudden illness requiring hospitalization. Keep debt under control If you have one or more loans, a one-time restructuring to settle smaller loans is beneficial. The money saved can be invested for future growth. If you have a larger loan, you may make partial prepayments by using your bonus or other surpluses to reduce the tenure. This helps saves the interest outflow. Divide your salary wisely You may request the human resource (HR) department to pay your salary in your savings and checking accounts separately. When you deposit money in the savings account regularly and do not spend it, you can save a huge amount over the years. Moreover, the rate of interest on savings accounts is higher when compared to other types of accounts. Lower your electricity bill Want to know how to save money at home? Reduce your electricity bill. Compared to regular bulbs, LED and compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) bulbs are more energy-efficient and last longer, which helps save money. Plugged-in electronic devices consume electricity; therefore, unplugging these when not in use is recommended. Moreover, seal your home to avoid loss of air, which can significantly add to the electricity bill. Avoid late payment fees Lack of planning may result in unnecessary late payment fees, which can reduce your income. Using an app to remind you of payment due dates and enabling autopay help to avoid these penalties and save money. Use money management apps Using a money management app is one of the best tips on how to save money. The app ensures all your bills and other dues are paid on time. It also helps you pay off outstanding dues and build a realistic plan for your monthly savings and expenditure. However, being disciplined is important to maximize the benefits of such an app. Save on transportation costs Using your vehicle for daily commute can be convenient; however, with the skyrocketing fuel prices, it can also be quite expensive. You can save a significant amount by opting for alternative ways to travel. To reduce fuel costs and maintenance expenses, use public transportation. Moreover, consider carpooling to the office and back or use shared cabs to reduce your travel expenses. Cut down the entertainment expenses Now, how is this the best way to save money? With various over-the-top (OTT) platforms, you may rarely watch anything on cable television. So, you may cancel your cable connection or pay only for the channels you watch regularly to save money. Moreover, most newspapers and magazines have free online apps, so canceling subscriptions to these can help reduce your costs. You may also discontinue the memberships for recreational activities that you do not use regularly. Further, booking movie tickets online can help save money via special offers. Prepare a budget for miscellaneous expenses Miscellaneous expenses include impulse purchases, home and auto repairs, and maintenance costs, and much more. You must estimate the budget for such unforeseen expenses. Classify these expenses into food, housing, shopping, and more, i",

The feature I want to discuss, UPI Lite, is also available on Google Pay and I generally use it on the Paytm app. However, I‚Äôve recently encountered some issues with Paytm and PhonePe is not functioning well on my device. Therefore, I would like to use the UPI Lite feature on the Jupiter App. Unfortunately, the UPI Lite feature is not available in the UPI payment section of the Jupiter Money App, which prevents me from using it as frequently as I use Paytm. I would like to request the Jupiter Money development team to include the UPI Lite feature in their app, as other payment apps already offer this service. Thank you. 4 Likes",

    "question": "My review on the new 3-in-1 switch credit card",
    "answer": "Dilipsingh45 (Dilip) 13 April 2024 11:55 1 I recently stumbled across the new Switch 3-in-1 credit card by Jupiter and it‚Äôs perfect so far. I‚Äôm not much of a credit card enthusiast but I do own 2 credit cards. I want to share my experience for this new credit card. Getting the card Last week, I got my switch credit card with a 1.5L limit. I also own an Amazon icici credit card but that limit is only 90k Packaging It‚Äôs not the best out there, but it was in a hard paper like flip envelope. The card was intact, and as soon as I opened it, was in love with the design so kudos to the one who came up with the concept Using the card I‚Äôm a heavy spender on online spends like Amazon and flipkart. The icici credit card doesn‚Äôt give me 3% cb (non prime) all the time. But this Switch card gives 2%, but for all online spending that‚Äôs a win-win for me. Occasionally, I spend on food apps like Swiggy so there also I get 0.4% cb (because I have shopping mode enabled) UPI method So far my default go-to payment method is UPI since there are like QR scanners everywhere. Before Jupiter, I used to use Gpay but they don‚Äôt give any cb on their scratch cards anymore. Hence moved to jupiter UPI since it‚Äôs faster. Even though I‚Äôm using UPI, the card is rupay, plus I get rewards on every transaction + mode spends makes my experience even better. Some improvements for the jupiter team @JupiterTeam If you can allow us to change modes as and when required, it would be even better. There are times when I spend more on food and I want to move to shopping mode, but I‚Äôm stuck at getting 2% on shopping mode. I will have to wait 4 months for switching. This suggestion is for anyone who opts for the card. Try making the cc kit better. I expect this card to be a premium card and it needs to come in a box. Like, make the kit half transparent half solid? Should be amazing then. I hope my limit increases as I spend on this credit card. That would be great, try adding some milestone rewards also. Eg: If I spend 30k on my credit card this month, I get a voucher (shopping related, or allow us to use which voucher/cb) So far so good and I think this is the best card for me. I did check out Tata neu though, but look and feel wise, this one was better. 7 Likes",

    "answer": "Angana_S (Angana Sripur) 29 December 2020 10:58 1 Originally published at: Where your money led you this pandemic > Jupiter Back in February of 2020, I‚Äôd gone to watch the Oscar-winning movie ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô with my friends. I wore a mask to the theatre, even if it meant I risked getting ridiculed. Murmurs of a global pandemic were only faint back then, but I wasn‚Äôt going to take my chances. After our movie session, we went to grab lunch and drinks at a popular local eatery. Little did we know that life as we know it, would not be the same again this year. If life is intriguing under the duress of a looming apocalypse then there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs even more intriguing: what people do with their money during such a time. In May, we started getting used to the idea of being holed up in our spaces and wrote a piece about the kind of money habits one can cultivate this lockdown. Now I thought it‚Äôd be worth exploring where our money has finally led us this year. I‚Äôm talking about pets, home improvement, weeknight takeouts, and workout classes. It seems like the things we chose to reduce or increase spending on, tell a deeper story. About our need to connect with something, distract ourselves from the void or just find better and more productive ways to use our money and to cut down spending. Here‚Äôs how we changed this year: We started making some long-term commitments in 2020 No, we‚Äôre not referring to people getting hitched amid a global pandemic, but more of the streaming subscription kinda commitment. Netflix reported that it added 28.1 million subscriptions in the first nine months of this year. The streaming giant started to see a surge in subscribers just about three months into the pandemic. Huh. Guess more people got to see Joe Exotic and his pet tiger‚Äôs charm amirite. While discretionary expenses reduced sharply during the lockdown, the months of May and June saw a jump in entertainment spends on OTT platforms and online games. Where you could be going with this: Once you go to Netflix, it‚Äôs hard to go back. You might want to hold on to your subscriptions because it seems like OTT is fast replacing the cinema, both in terms of quality and quantity. Besides, the sheer joy of paying for something once but being able to experience the benefits over some time feels pretty good. We also sought out comfort food to accompany our streaming habits Remember that dystopian movie where the protagonist ran out of Maggi and had to resort to eating his roommate‚Äôs flesh? Guess we aren‚Äôt describing the plot of a movie, as much as the state of our supermarkets this year. Nestle India Ltd. saw a surge in sales of Maggi for the quarter of March. People were also stocking up on biscuits and KitKat bars. Where you could be going with this: You may continue to lean on comfort foods even after you‚Äôre able to go to restaurants again simply because ordering-in has become a matter of convenience. Maybe the pandemic has urged you to re-examine your non-discretionary expenses, like chilling in a bar every Friday night over drinks? We‚Äôre spending more on living things this pandemic My friend on the phone: ‚ÄúSo how are you spending time this year?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Things have gotten excruciatingly boring, I‚Äôm almost thinking I should get a pet?‚Äù My friend: ‚ÄúBut you hate pets!‚Äù Me: I know If this conversation sounds familiar then it‚Äôs probably a case of lockdown pet syndrome (alright I might have made up that word). But lockdown loneliness is real, and it seems that people are getting themselves pets to cope with the sense of silent dread that fills their home. People who already have pets were also seen spending more on toys and treats. Lucky year for pets I‚Äôd say. Where you could be going with this: It seems that an increase in pet-buying is directly proportional to the intensity of one‚Äôs loneliness tehehe. Once you‚Äôre out and about meeting people again, you may just stick to buying that cactus for your work desk that dies every three months. Get this: Our Long-term savings might not have increased enough for us to buy those AirPods You‚Äôd think that if people were living in their peejays and skipping Friday drinks, that they‚Äôd save a ton of money. It turns out that most people‚Äôs small budget changes don‚Äôt actually amount to a significant increase in long-term savings. We were a little surprised by this hypothesis too, except it adds up because most of these budget cuts were forced upon people and they‚Äôre going to revert to their pre-pandemic spe",

    "question": "The Reckoning: Why we need our bank to help us save better, now more than ever",
    "answer": "Angana_S (Angana Sripur) 18 July 2020 16:23 1 Originally published at: https://blog.jupiter.money/2020/07/digital-banking-and-better-savings/ I recently learnt about a very interesting cultural code. The Amish, who are known for their aversion to technology (we‚Äôre talking television and cars), have a distinct method of choosing what technology they allow into their lives. The bearings they select are usually value-driven and purposeful. Essentially, they adopt a much more nuanced approach to the use of modern tech. Most of us today live quite contrary to the Amish, if I were to make that blatant assumption. We‚Äôve allowed modern technology to seep into every single aspect of our lives ‚Äì from toothbrushes with timestamps to Alexa-powered homes. We let artificial intelligence and social media tell us how to live (evidenced by an Instagram feed that‚Äôs filled with fairy lights and intergalactic-themed sneakers). So it‚Äôs quite astonishing that in the age of interactive VR movies and robot waiters, there‚Äôs a fundamental area of our lives that remains untouched by modern tech; an aspect that fuels this overly-consumerist lifestyle in the first place ‚Äì Saving money. In fact, the banking apps on our phones (the ones that are supposed to help us manage our money on the go) have done frustratingly little to help us save, and consistently failed to add value to our everyday lives. So much so that if we were to take the Amish approach to tech, we might just shun them altogether. Banking today, and its role in our saving struggle Our founder has an interesting way to sum up everything that‚Äôs wrong with banking today: ‚ÄúLooks digital, feels analog‚Äù. This is the most lucid description of the subject at hand, yet conveying the ‚Äòdeepest feels‚Äô (pardon the use of this very millennial term). Which leads me down to the path of understanding how our current banking setup impacts our ability to save. We surveyed users about their biggest saving concerns and here‚Äôs what we found: 34% of respondents didn‚Äôt know where to put their savings 22% weren‚Äôt regular with their savings, while 15% ended up spending what they should have saved. People don‚Äôt feel they‚Äôre equipped with the right tools to save, and a lot of it is entrusted to sheer self-control. Money is complex, and providing personalized methods to save is a far cry from what our current banking experience offers. Our banks mostly act as a dummy locker to store moolah, rather than a smart advisor of all things money. The takeaway from this is clear as day: As digital natives, our lifestyle encompasses manifold goals, and a cookie-cutter approach to savings with unintelligible jargon such as ‚ÄòXtra FD‚Äô does nothing to soothe our senses. To top that, we‚Äôre also usually left dealing with disappearing relationship managers and a mumbo-jumbo of incomprehensible investment terms and conditions, making us pretty damn clueless about how to save or invest our money. We need an overhaul, for real. So what does banking reimagined actually look like? Imagine a setup where all you had to do was input your goals with the date that you want to achieve it and let your bank do the rest? From saving regularly, to investing smartly. Like if your app auto-saves a sum of ‚Çπ1,000 every time you run a marathon, for your goal of purchasing a suave pair of sneakers. And it also invests 10% of your bill, every single time you splurge on a Venti Latte at Starbucks (Goodbye Starbucks addiction). Think of this setup as hiring a spiritual guide for your savings. They show you the path and get you closer to your goals. ‚ÄúAnd then what, Dr. Phil?‚Äù Invest it; automatically of course, based on your past behavior, risk appetite, and current market conditions. Obviously, those are three traits with the pesky habit of changing ever so often ‚Äì but your banking app should be able to change or update your investment recommendations accordingly. In fact, you never have to let your savings just‚Ä¶idle around. That‚Äôs where a modern banking app should not only be able to figure out the excess money you have, but move it into higher-yield, low-risk instruments like Liquid Mutual Funds and RDs. ‚ÄúOh boy! Sounds wild! Too bad none of this is real.‚Äù Well, here‚Äôs the good news: An autonomous future for your money is pretty much on the horizon. And that‚Äôs the new banking experience we‚Äôre building. And we‚Äôd love for you to build it with us, one feature at a time. We‚Äôre not sure if the Amish will be pleased, but we sure as hell hope you are. 4 Li",

    "answer": "Shawnpinto (Shawn Pinto) 8 February 2024 13:17 1 Hi everyone! We‚Äôre back with another uncomfortable situation around money. Most of us have already faced this. So let‚Äôs get to it. Situation for the week You‚Äôve lent some money to your friend. He wanted to buy something urgently and didn‚Äôt have the funds at that moment. Since you‚Äôre his friend, and trying to help him out, you‚Äôve lent him the money. A few weeks later, your friend seems relaxed and looks like he has the funds to buy things for himself. On a random day, both of you go for lunch and while paying the bill, he hesitates. Nudging you to pay the bill instead. Remember, he still owes you the money you‚Äôve lent. Yet, asks for more by paying his share. It‚Äôs a common story: a friend in need, an open hand, and a promise to repay. But what happens when that promise lingers unfulfilled, leaving you caught between financial strain and a strained friendship? The situation is delicate. You value your friend, yet the unpaid loan creates tension. Every reminder feels awkward, every unanswered message stings. Your choices You will need to pick 1 of the below choices: I would recall the money I lent him I would pay the bill now, remind him to pay both later Make him pay now and recall the the money I lent Something else? Comment below! 0 voters Ultimately, the decision is yours Remember, clear communication and setting boundaries early on can prevent such situations in the future. Lending money can be an act of friendship, but it‚Äôs crucial to treat it like a financial transaction as well, protecting both your wallet and your bond. So, what would you do in this situation?

    "question": "Laying the foundations of a new financial system",
    "answer": "Angana_S (Angana Sripur) 14 December 2020 07:30 1 Originally published at: Laying the foundations of a new financial system > Jupiter In a remote village somewhere in Phulera in UP, an engineering graduate turned Panchayat secretary was studying for his CAT. He decided to take a break from his studies to go get a chai. After placing the empty chai glass on the counter, he took out his mobile phone from his pocket and paid the chaiwaala. If you think we‚Äôre starting to describe the plot of the hit Amazon Prime series Panchayat, well‚Ä¶no. What we are starting to describe is the story of the holy grail of payments in India: UPI. A decade ago, a scenario like that would have provoked disbelief. Today, it‚Äôs pretty much the preferred way of paying for both consumers and merchants. The idea that it‚Äôs easier to pay for a cab in Jharkhand than in New York is quite intriguing, to say the least. So, let‚Äôs explore how we got here. Humble beginnings of a payments revolution In the summer of 2011, the average Indian was making only about six non-cash transactions per year. If you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs how many mobile payments I make in a day!‚Äù, there were several reasons why digital transactions weren‚Äôt widespread back then. On one hand, 145 million households were excluded from banking. On the other, only a fraction of retailers (10 m) accepted card payments, while options like NEFT and cheques were obviously not suited for small-ticket transactions. It was at this time that the NPCI (a non-profit entity and quasi-regulator of payments, set up by the RBI), was mulling over the establishment of a payments system that was more inclusive and comprehensive of all sections of society. They were also starting to notice the success of the IMPS (Immediate Payments Service) set up in 2010, which allowed for inter-bank transfers between any two bank accounts in real-time, through a mobile phone. Meanwhile, there were a few other developments that were setting the Indian landscape up for a revolution: The launch of Aadhar sowed the seeds of giving Indians a ‚ÄòDigital identity‚Äô. Over 1.1 Billion people were enrolled in Aadhar, which aimed to give every individual a verifiable 12-digit identification number connected to biometric data. The advent of this type of identity program meant that there was potential to start linking Aadhar to bank accounts, hence leading to more financial inclusion. There was also the Prime Minister‚Äôs Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), that gave people access to financial services such as savings and deposit accounts, remittance, credit, insurance, and pension to citizens. This led to 270 million bank accounts being opened by Feb 2017, thus bringing into the fold all those people who were excluded from the banking system. Another important development of the time was the massive increase in smartphone adoption. By 2016, India‚Äôs mobile phone subscriber base crossed the 1 billion users mark. This brings us to the key government initiative that helped accelerate payments in India, by tying all these developments together- JAM (Jan-Dhan Aadhaar Mobile). The idea of JAM was to link bank accounts, Aadhaar numbers, and mobile phone numbers. The government could use this as a ‚Äòmapper‚Äô, for various other initiatives such as providing LPG subsidy or disbursing large-scale payments (think COVID relief fund). Now we circle back to the NPCI and their conundrum: How do they create the next generation of digital payments while achieving financial inclusion along with an increasingly cashless economy. We already had a billion people with access to mobile phones, and a growing number of millions with bank accounts, what the NPCI needed was to find a point of convergence between the two. Enter UPI. UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is a secure, reliable, and mobile-first method of interoperable transfers. It uses a ‚Äò VPA‚Äô (Virtual Payment Address) that links to a global identifier (such as an Aadhar number) to let people send or receive money. Remember the objective with which JAM was launched? It pretty much helped bring UPI to life. Now all of this meant that people could make a payment transaction by exchanging the bare minimum amount of sensitive information required. In fact, it was almost like an email ID with your bank‚Äôs name and required none of the hassles that came with entering your IFS codes or adding beneficiaries when one used the good ol‚Äô NEFT transfers.

Once you click on it, it could possibly show 3 things - No. of people for splitting, choose people from contacts and the amount. The amount could change when we + or - contacts just for us to see. (I guess we don‚Äôt have to pop out our calculators for this! ) Once we have the contacts for selection, you would be able to generate a payment request for them. They would get a notification and see a request on the Home page. Possible add ons: The user who has requested the split can see the status of the pending and cleared payments. Something like a checkbox or progress bar. Give a time limit (Or is it too extreme?) Show a unique symbol/tag for those transactions that had been split. So what do you think about splitting bills? Have you used this feature on other apps? If you have, let us know your thoughts so that we can improve your experience! 10 Likes Splitwise like feature How often do you split bills? üßæ",

    "question": "A retail investor's tryst with the markets - Part 2",
    "answer": "Angana_S (Angana Sripur) 12 October 2020 16:41 1 Originally published at: A retail investor's tryst with the markets - Part 2 > Jupiter Back to the future It‚Äôs in 2050. You‚Äôve just put down your simulated cup of coffee that auto-refills every time you crave caffeine. But first things first, you‚Äôve got to make your daily wage. You wear your VR headset to watch an interactive movie. You‚Äôre the central character and you have to buy and sell stocks as the story progresses (Yes Bandersnatch got all too real). Your Tuesday morning #richnnessscore goes down 2% and you‚Äôre shifted to a lower floor for the rest of the day. Fine. Got a little ahead there. Where were we again? Oh yes, burgeoning digital India that was fueled with giddy optimism about investing, after our resilient response to the global recession. The investing industry‚Äôs AUM hit a milestone of ‚Çπ10 Trillion in May 2014, while AMFI ran a ‚ÄòMutual Funds Sahi Hai‚Äô campaign to encourage people to shift from physical savings to financial avenues like investing in stocks and mutual funds. By 2015, SIPs had become the bold alternative to bank FDs. Take, for instance, this article in a leading publication that claimed ‚ÄòThis lakhpati started with an SIP of Rs 500 in an ELSS mutual fund‚Äô. While this story might sound outlandish, it reflected the pulse of the markets and the outlook of the people during the time. Uma Shanker was a representation of millions of Indians relying on tips-based investing for quick gains. This-just-in Suffice to say, these investing attitudes were mostly status-quo until television sets flashed with ‚ÄòBreaking news‚Äô headlines on 8th September 2016- the demonetisation announcement. A moment probably reminiscent of the emotions that were triggered in 1991 (Ahem, if you don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre talking about, you should read this piece). This move galvanized more money to flow into the markets, as with more money chasing limited assets India‚Äôs gen X started pouring their household savings into financial assets such as equity, debt, deposits, and insurance. The markets were soaring higher than ever before, and retail investors were high-spirited about the steady rise in their money. It felt like all was still kosher. A rude awakening After a period of considerable merry in the markets, things were starting to wobble rather uncomfortably. Investors went from soaring to shaky real quick when the ILFS, DHFL, and YES Bank fiascos came to light. The scam at IL&FS started to raise questions after several group entities defaulted on repayments due to severe liquidity problems. Mutual funds that invested in IL&FS debt paper stopped encashments. Next, DHFL, the non-banking finance company stopped acceptance and renewal of fixed deposits. Eventually, DHFL‚Äôs stock took a hammering, by as much as 60%. Finally, there was YES Bank which capped deposit withdrawals after RBI imposed a 30-day moratorium on them as they faltered on NPAs and their share price went down. The nature of these debacles started to raise questions about NBFCs and the safety of one‚Äôs principal. The terror following these events wasn‚Äôt widespread but surely started to dent people‚Äôs trust in the machinery. The plot thickens As if this tumbledown wasn‚Äôt enough, no one was prepared for what the universe was going to throw next. As the historian, Will Durant rightly said, ‚ÄúLogic is an invention of man and may be ignored by the universe‚Äù. And boy has this never rung truer for retail investors whose portfolios were hit by the COVID 19, which was the final nail in the coffin. For a lot of millennials, this was their first taste of financial debauchery gone wrong. The pandemic brought upon a crushing realisation- Investment truly is subject to market risk and it also means that you could be risking your principal in times of a crisis. It‚Äôs like Morgan Housel says in his blog, ‚ÄúThe biggest risk is always whatever no one is talking about or thinking about because by definition they‚Äôre not prepared for it‚Äù. Rolling with the punches The pandemic brought about a slew of contradictions that started to baffle retail investors like never before. Quantitative easing by governments across the globe put money in everyone‚Äôs pockets and revived the markets despite the massive economic slowdown. This also led to a decoupling of the stock market and the falling economy. Despite the nature of the events that were unfolding, the message to retail investors was clear; Re-evaluate how you treat your investments. While we‚Äôd ",

So every time you spend, you can invest ‚Çπ10 or more in a Mutual Fund. It‚Äôs fully automatic and works in the background, while you go about spending as usual. For example, if you spend ‚Çπ500 on Swiggy, a minimum of ‚Çπ10 goes to a Mutual fund of your choice. And you can set a monthly upper limit to be invested. That means if you want, you can invest only up to ‚Çπ1500 in a month. Here‚Äôs more Q. What can a ‚Çπ10 investment even do? Even these seemingly small amounts add up over time, thanks to the power of compounding. Imagine the magic of having your daily chai contribute to your dream vacation or retirement fund! Q.

If you‚Äôre still wondering what this is, here‚Äôs the introduction for the series - Introducing Money situations series! News from Jupiter Hello Community! Hope everyone is doing well Just wanted to talk about a thought around how we interact with money in our daily lives. [Banner] Money makes the world go round, and let‚Äôs be honest, it can also cause stress and awkward silence Whether you‚Äôre struggling to make ends meet, navigating student loans, or planning for retirement, money is a deeply personal topic that often feels off-limits in conversation. But here‚Äôs the thing: money doesn‚Äôt have to‚Ä¶ So let‚Äôs start. Situation for the week Let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs been a tiring day at work and you and your friends planned to have a dinner party. It continues for hours and seems to be a lot of fun! Folks ordered a lot of food & drinks and no one was keeping track of the bill. After some time, you call for the waiter and the bill arrives The bill amounts to Rs. 7000 and 4 friends are involved, including yourself. Things to consider - All you had was 1 salad and maybe a coke. Not much. It‚Äôs time to pay up but you are thinking about splitting the bill equally or step up and tell your friends about how much you had to pay. Or maybe, another alternative to this? Your choices You will need to pick 1 of the below choices: I will split the bill equally I will only pay for my share Ask someone to pay for my share & pay later Something else? Comment below! 0 voters What would you do in this situation? There is no right answer. Let us know in the comments below if you‚Äôve faced this situation or a similar one.

    "answer": "Debosmit_Majumder (Debosmit Majumder) 18 October 2021 20:22 1 Jewels - the one prominent thing which drives us all to do day-to-day transactions using Jupiter! I went through the forums to see a lot of frustration and negative rant over Jewels not being credited. Here‚Äôs my quick take on the underlying tech: All your payments go through a processor, payment gateway and payment aggregator. The payment gateway declares the payment as a P2M payment (also generates transaction ID and payable amount), whereas the payment aggregator returns the Merchant details and Payment Options (and associates it with Order ID). Until this point, it‚Äôs obvious that if you make a P2M - payment to merchant, you will be getting jewels 100% The confusion happens with the introduction of a third party - the m-Wallet (likes of Paytm Wallet, PhonePe Wallet, Mobikwik Wallet, PayZapp Wallet etc.). Over the years these wallets (not their UPI counterparts) have created a nice wrapper over the payment processors‚Äô pages (most notably Paytm) and made the process so seamless that you would feel your payments are going through directly with your card. But actually, it‚Äôs Your Card/UPI to Payment Aggregator - PA1 to Payment Processor to Wallet Account to Payment Aggregator - PA2 to Payment Processor to Merchant‚Äôs Holding Account with PA2. (In most cases, PA1 and PA2 are the same or PA1 is owned by/partnered with the Wallet Provider to curb in-flow charges) In the above case, the payments do not reflect the actual Merchant ID descriptor and instead shows the wallet Merchant ID descriptor (such as PAYTM, MOBIKWIK, ICICIPKTS) - which are in turn added as filters in Jupiter algorithm to not reward the same - unless you are using a relatively obscure wallet platform which can still pass off as a merchant transaction. Explicit filters are also added to other merchant sources such as Loan Platforms and Gaming/Betting Platforms - but from all my tests, they are still not optimal as payment aggregators often don‚Äôt report the correct parameters of such merchants - and Jupiter devs have to flag them manually based on descriptors. 7 Likes",

    "question": "Renting vs Buying a House: Which is Better? | Jupiter",
    "answer": "JupiterTeam (Jupiter Team) 25 June 2021 19:10 1 Buying a house is the ultimate dream of most people in India, but does it really make more financial sense than renting a property? Well, the answer depends on multiple factors and personal choices. This article focuses on various aspects of buying vs. renting a home. If you are confused between both options, read on to make the right decision.Difference between renting and buyingThe fundamental difference between buying and renting a house is ownership. When you buy a property, you own it, and that does not happen when you rent one. But this is not the only thing to consider. Here are three important factors that can help determine your decision.1. Rent ratioIt is the ratio of the price of the property to its yearly rent. If the property‚Äôs worth is 20x the annual rent, it is advisable to buy it. Suppose you pay a monthly rent of ‚Çπ25,000 for a house, it amounts to ‚Çπ3 lakhs per year. If you live in that house for 20 years, it will cost you ‚Çπ60 lakhs in total. If the property's price is less than ‚Çπ60 lakhs, the rent ratio is favorable for purchasing the property instead of renting. But, if the price of the house is over ‚Çπ60 lakhs, renting it makes more sense.2. Rental yieldIt is the measure of cash your house can generate every year as a percentage of the property value. Suppose you have bought a house for ‚Çπ75 lakhs and rented it out for ‚Çπ20,000 a month. So, the property is currently generating ‚Çπ2.4 lakhs per year, which is 3.2% of its actual value. If you consider the property tax and maintenance expenses you have to bear every year, the rental yield can turn out to be less than 3%. Experts suggest that buying a house makes sense only if the rental yield is over 5%. Practically speaking, that is a distant dream in today‚Äôs scenario, especially in metro cities where the rental yield is around 2% to 3%.3. EMI valueIf you take a loan to buy a property, you must consider the repayment expenses while determining whether the property will be profitable for you. A rule of thumb is, if the equated monthly installment (EMI) is more than 30% of your monthly income, it is not advisable to purchase the property and vice versa.Advantages of renting a house1. Reduced responsibilitiesLiving in a rental property entails lesser responsibilities and costs. You only need to pay the rent and unincluded utilities for a rented property while the owner pays for the taxes, repair costs, and maintenance expenses.2. Low upfront costsBuying a property comes with many upfront expenses that may put a dent in your budget. On the other hand, if you rent a house, you may have to pay a security deposit and a few months‚Äô rent in advance. So, it will be more affordable to rent the property than to buy one.3. Easy to relocateIt is easy to leave a rented house as it is by definition a short-term arrangement. So, if you need to change cities, you may easily leave the old house and find another one in the new city you move to.Disadvantages of renting a house1. You have no controlWhen you rent a property, almost all the power belongs to its owner. They can periodically increase the rent and even make it unavailable for renting at any time. These uncertainties make renting a property a risky option.2. You can never make it your ownYou cannot make changes to the rented house in most cases. Some owners do not even let you hang a painting and modifying without their permission may result in the loss of the security deposit.Advantages of buying a house1. SecurityWhen it comes to renting vs. buying a house, the one aspect that gives a significant advantage to buying is security. When you buy a property, you own it and have the right to decide how long you want to stay there. Moreover, you can freely make modifications as per your needs and even sell it whenever you want.2. It is an investmentA house is an asset that increases in value over time. So, you can treat buying a property as an investment. It gives you the freedom to sell the house and make a profit. You can even rent it to generate regular income.Disadvantages of buying a house1. Huge responsibilityOwning a house comes with a lot of responsibilities and added expenses. You have to pay for maintenance, property tax, utilities, and much more out of your pocket.2. Difficult to move outInvesting in a house means you will have to rethink before moving. If you get a dream job in another city, you cannot leave until you find a buyer or tenant.3. High upfront costs",

    "question": "Return on Investment Calculator | How to Calculate ROI | ROI Formula | Jupiter",
    "answer": "JupiterTeam (Jupiter Team) 23 June 2021 18:22 1 Successful investors always take every precautionary measure to put their money in the most profitable instruments. There are multiple ways you can compare different investment options to determine which offers the highest returns. One popular method is the Return on Investment (ROI). You can use an ROI calculator to compare different investment products quickly. What is Return on Investment (ROI)? ROI shows the ratio between total profits made from an investment and the total investment cost. Simply put, you can use the ROI method to compare the invested amount and the income earned. It also helps understand the profitability of an investment option and decide if it is a good choice for you. Another important aspect of ROI is that you get the answer in percentage form. So, if the calculation shows the result is 0.20, it means the ROI is 20%. ROI is a commonly used method to calculate investment profitability because it is quick and simple. Moreover, the data required for ROI is easy to determine; you know how much money you will invest, and most investment products show the potential returns. Additionally, ROI shows the result in percentage form, which is easy to understand. It makes comparing different investment options a simple task, allowing you to choose the best financial instrument. One essential thing to know about ROI is that it refers to different types of measurements, which include Average Rate of Return (ARR), Earnings per Share (EPS), and the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). But investors use it more frequently to measure the simple return on investment. You can estimate ROI in seconds by using an ROI calculator online. About ROI calculator The calculator allows you to compute ROI effortlessly. It has sections where you need to provide the investment amount and expected returns. You must also mention the investment period for the tool to work. Once you input the details, the calculator will show you the Gain on Investment, Return on Investment, Absolute ROI, and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). The formula to measure ROI The calculator makes it simple for you to determine the ROI, but it is always wise to learn how the ROI formula works. It plays a crucial role in investments and can make all the difference between choosing the right investment product and suffering loss. To use the formula, you need Gain from Investment (G) and Cost of Investment (C). Based on the above information, the formula is ROI = [(G ‚Äì C) / C]. You can multiply the result by 100 to determine ROI percentage. One disadvantage of the formula is that it only considers the numerical values provided but cannot calculate the associated risk with any investment instrument. How does the ROI calculator work? Now that you know how to calculate ROI using the formula, it is time to understand how the calculator works with the equation. When you input investment amount, expected returns, and investment period, the calculator uses the above formula to determine Absolute Return. It then shows the value in percentage form. As you can see, calculating the Absolute Return does not require using the investment period. But the calculator needs the information to determine Annualized Return on Investment, which is the investment product‚Äôs performance over different periods. The formula for Annualized ROI is more extensive compared to Absolute Return. Let us understand both aspects of using ROI with different examples. Example of ROI calculation Suppose you bought a property worth ‚Çπ60 lakhs, and you sell it for ‚Çπ90 lakhs after 5 years. By using the formula, [(G ‚Äì C) / C], we get the Absolute Return: (‚Çπ90 lakhs ‚Äì ‚Çπ60 lakhs) / ‚Çπ60 lakhs = 0.50. So, the return on the investment in your property is 50%. Annualized Return on Investment (ROI) formula and example The basic ROI calculation formula does not include the period during which you held the investment, which is the holding period. If you want to take the holding period into account, Annualized ROI can help. The formula for Annualized ROI: [(1+ROI)1/n ‚àí 1] x 100% In the formula, ‚Äòn‚Äô is the holding period in terms of the number of years. Let us apply the same example as above to understand how the calculation for Annualized ROI works. Investment: ‚Çπ60 lakhs Total return: ‚Çπ90 lakhs ROI: 0.50 Holding period: 5 years So, the Annualized ROI is [(1 + 0.50)1/5 ‚àí 1] x 100% = 8.45%. If the holding period is less than a year, you can still use the formula by",

    "question": "How the pandemic-hit market can show you your actual risk appetite",
    "answer": "aniket (Aniket Tamboli) 16 July 2020 06:45 1 Originally published at: https://blog.jupiter.money/2020/04/covid-19-rethink-risk-appetite/ The economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 lockdown has spooked investors and straight-up KO‚Äôd markets. For the first time in a decade, we‚Äôre witnessing a full-blown bear market. To put things into perspective ‚Äì in 2008, markets fell 60% in 8 months; in 2020, they‚Äôve fallen over 40% in 15 days! If all this is making you question your risk tolerance, you‚Äôre not alone. Even if you ‚Äúaren‚Äôt into investing,‚Äù watching your Rs.1L worth of SIP investments show up as ~Rs.62.7k is going to jolt you awake. So here‚Äôs some food for thought ‚Äì should you have questioned yourself the same way when you first made the investment? Look back to the time when you filled a risk assessment survey on your investment portal. It probably told you that you‚Äôre a ‚Äúmoderately aggressive‚Äù investor. What did that really mean then and how do you feel about that assessment now? ‚ÄúRisk? I like to live dangerously haha.‚Äù Cool it, Austin Powers. If you‚Äôre like most people, you invest as a way to secure your future and actually meet your goals and aspirations. But you‚Äôre dealing with hard-earned money; and while a large part of your decisions might be very rational, it is important to pay attention to your comfort-level with taking risks. Investments across different classes have different risk-return grades. Each person has a different risk tolerance, which depends on several factors ‚Äì like your short- and long-term goals, age and life-stage, income stability, and savings to name a few. Accurately understanding your risk tolerance can help you deal with rude shocks when the numbers fall (like they are right now). Will it hurt any less? Probably not. But, will you have a cushion because you factored in this possibility? Definitely yes. ‚ÄúWhat would you do if the markets fell by 25%‚Äù The most commonly used method of gauging risk appetite are questionnaires that evaluate responses to hypothetical market scenarios. However, the method isn‚Äôt without its criticisms ‚Äì like that it‚Äôs a one-time activity and over-relies on psychometrics. Perhaps its biggest deficiency, though, is estimating loss-tolerance. During good times, we tend to be complacent and underestimate how much ‚Äúdownside‚Äù we can withstand. If you assessed your risk tolerance during sunnier days, chances are you overestimated it. Unfortunately, no one can know precisely what their tolerance for financial loss is until they hit said tolerance. You think babies are adorable right up until one throws up on you after a really long day at work. That‚Äôs where a good financial advisor can come in. (Focus, we‚Äôve moved on from the baby) Through in-person discussions, experienced planners gauge softer aspects like loss-aversion and anxiety, by probing deeper into your motives and searching for parallels in your past. Aspects that cannot be assessed through a standard questionnaire. Problem is, much like a half-hearted mall-security pat-down, risk profiling is often seen as an administrative ‚Äòto-do‚Äô item and nothing more. As a result, we often end up with portfolios that don‚Äôt align with our actual risk profile. And we don‚Äôt even realise or question this when the going is good. But when things go south, the effects are painful. Better late now than never If you started investing in equity markets in the last 4-5 years, this is probably the first time you‚Äôre experiencing a freely-falling market (with the possibility of prolonged lows and losses). Taking that risk assessment survey now will give you a better idea about how much risk and loss you can really tolerate. These basic questions are a good starting point: How uncomfortable are you with your portfolio‚Äôs performance right now? How often does it play on your mind? Is it making you overly anxious? What additional drop in your portfolio value are you ok taking, before you cut your losses? How much longer will you hold onto your investments, knowing that they will recover at some point in the years to come? If answers to these questions make you squeamish, maybe you have taken on (or been ill-advised to take) more risk than you‚Äôre comfortable with. Now would be a great time to reassess this and course-correct, so that you can deal with the near-term uncertainty and stick to the long-term play. Don‚Äôt worry, none of this is as overwhelming as it might sound. In fact, we have a quick and easy risk assessment test to get you ",

    "question": "COVID-19 Insurance | Too much fine-print, too little cover?",
    "answer": "jigar (Jigar Vachharajani) 25 July 2020 07:30 1 Originally published at: https://blog.jupiter.money/2020/04/covid19-insurance-cover/ This handy blog was written by Jigar , Head of Finance at SalesKen and a Jupiter Community member! If you‚Äôd like to contribute to the Jupiter Blog, ping us @sneh.baxi @sahil-sorathiya In less than 4 months, COVID-19 has completely shaken up the world. Economies across the globe, whether large or small, are in the same boat, fighting this pandemic ‚Äì and India is no different. The fear of COVID-19 is mounting by the day and people are more cautious than ever before. Wary of this situation and pandemic, several health insurance companies have come out with health covers exclusively for the Coronavirus disease. COVID-19 coverage on a single click and at very low premiums (in the range of INR 150 to 1,000) is the motto of most of these insurers. Considering the panic on account of COVID-19, it becomes very important for everyone to not jump the gun in haste, but instead make a well-informed decision about purchasing COVID-exclusive insurance covers. Policy in a single click, without a single test? Yes, you heard it right, but it is important to understand how insurers cover their risk of issuing policies to COVID-19-positive cases. If you look closely, all the policies available today have an initial waiting period of 14-16 days, i.e., the policy will become effective only after completion of the said period. If a person is diagnosed COVID-positive within the waiting period, the cover is not applicable. Furthermore, most of these policies have ‚Äòinternational travel restriction clauses,‚Äô which deny benefits to anyone with a history of international travel over the last 45-60 days. Some of the policies also have a cohabitation clause, which states that if a person is cohabiting with someone already diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, they will not be eligible for the cover. One more noteworthy fact is that most insurers are covering only up to the age group of 65 years. This is based on an underlying assumption that senior citizens are more vulnerable to the virus. All these entry-level restrictions help insurers reduce the risk quotient substantially, while issuing the policy to individuals at large. Various coverages on offer Broadly, there are two types of covers which are available in the market: Fixed benefit cover: Basically a lump sum cover assuring a fixed sum benefit to the COVID-19 positive cases. These policies cover between INR 20,000 and 50,000. Indemnity cover: Provides hospitalization expenses (both pre and post) at actuals on diagnosis of COVID-19. A key point to look out for in a fixed benefit cover is whether in-patient hospitalization is mandatory for claiming the benefit or not. Majority of fixed benefit covers honor the claim only if the patient is hospitalized and mere diagnosis will not make them eligible for the benefit. Home quarantine or self-isolation is not considered as being quarantined and so cannot be considered for the claim benefit. Further, in almost all the covers, claims are eligible only if the insured person is identified and tested COVID-19-positive by a Government-accredited hospital or testing centre. Any test from unauthorized centres will not be considered for the purposes of the claim. Some of the factors which can be considered in deciding the cover and the option: Age of a person: Anyone within the age group of 25-40 (with lesser risk of symptomatic COVID case), can opt for the fixed benefit option, while others can consider indemnity option. Also, anyone above the age of 45 should opt for a higher coverage, since hospitalization and treatment costs for respiratory illness would be substantially higher. City of residence: A metro resident (opting for an indemnity plan) needs to opt for higher coverage than a non-metro resident. Anything above INR 1 Lakh of cover would be good for a metro resident. Coverage in the existing policy: Anyone who already holds a mediclaim cover may not opt for either option as COVID-19 is covered in most mediclaim policies. However, if they are residing in a ‚Äòhotspot region,‚Äô a fixed benefit cover can be beneficial. Things to consider while making a decision ‚Äì If you currently hold a Mediclaim policy, verify whether it covers COVID as an illness. Most policies do cover the disease and you may not need a separate COVID-exclusive cover. This is ignored by most individuals in such panic situations. ‚Äì Go through all the restric",

Cards1080√ó1080 112 KB While the idea of a redesigned app has always been on the cards, the team started working on it in November 2023. 6 months and 600 screens later, we‚Äôre ready to go live with a Jupiter that‚Äôs bolder, more confident, and true to our mission of improving the financial wellness for millions of people.

The interface is smoother and faster, illustrations are bolder, typography is modern & unique, and key numbers are in the spotlight. But there‚Äôs more to come, so keep an eye on your Jupiter app. Ok Jupiter, show me the new colour palette To give you a picture, these are the colours we‚Äôll mostly be known for image1334√ó1314 63 KB Let‚Äôs break it done, shade by shade. The stark white has been paired with a warm beige. This is a easier on the eyes, even if you‚Äôre looking at your screen in maximum brightness. We also introduced teal, light green, yellow ochre, and darker greys in our palette. These act as pops of colour, without being overwhelming. The iconic spacefire orange still remains, but in accents and highlights. While the Jupiter app you knew and loved was bright and playful with a unique space them, the Jupiter we‚Äôve now created is modern, confident, and focused completely on tools for your financial wellness. But why did we redesign the app? A consistent and seamless user experience: As you move from one screen to another, across Pots, investments, loans, or credit card ‚Äì the app now feels like parts of a whole rather than disconnected parts.

    "question": "Spending directly from Pots",
    "answer": "holysmoke (Holysmoke) 24 June 2025 08:33 1 Yeah! So this has been requested before. The moderators also highlighted that they think pots are physically piggy banks. However, that‚Äôs not how I, and it seems many others, use the feature. I keep depositing a predictable amount of money into a pot called ‚Äúcar repairs‚Äù and when it‚Äôs time to service the car I pay from this pot. Now the paying part is very cumbersome, I have to first withdraw from the pot which now costs 2 hours. Another example is if I have a medical account, so if a family member is ill, I may need to make several small payments over, say, 72 hours. It‚Äôs again cumbersome to pay from the main savings account and then calculate manually and withdraw from the pot. Ideally, one should be able to add a pot as a linked account. So while scanning a QR code I have an option to pay. This feature I do believe forces fiscal discipline like nothing else if the team can realize it. Maybe another type of pot (not backed by FD necessarily, the idea is not earning a return but keeping expense accounts segregated. Overall a great app and cheers to the team.",

    "answer": "JupiterTeam (Jupiter Team) 29 June 2021 04:05 1 PAN, or Permanent Account Number, is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric identity for Indian taxpayers. While applying for a PAN card is optional, it is mandatory to quote your PAN number for certain financial transactions, such as payments over INR 50,000.It is also compulsory for individuals to have a PAN card if they receive a taxable salary or professional fees or invest in mutual funds.Overall, the key objective of the PAN card system is to act as a universal identification key for tracking financial transactions and preventing tax evasion, particularly by high net worth individuals.Who Can Apply for a New PAN Card?Anybody who earns a taxable income in India, including children and foreign nationals who pay taxes in India, must apply for a PAN card with the Income Tax Department of India. Besides salaried individuals, those running a business or freelancing and earning over INR 5 lakhs in a financial year should also apply for a PAN card.Even if your income isn‚Äôt taxable, having a PAN card is helpful when you‚Äôre opening a new bank account, investing in mutual funds, or purchasing foreign currency to travel abroad.How to Apply for a PAN CardThe Government of India has simplified the PAN card application process. Applicants can apply for a PAN card through both online and offline methods.To apply for the card online, you may visit the NSDL portal or UTITSL website to process your application in a seamless, swift and contactless manner.For offline applications, you‚Äôre required to fill up and submit Form 49A for Indian citizens from either of these sites and send the duly filled and signed form to the concerned authority for it to get processed.The Charges for Processing Your PAN ApplicationAccording to the Income Tax Department, the charges for applying for PAN are INR 93 (Excluding Goods and Services tax‚Äã) for an Indian address and INR 864 (Excluding Goods and Services tax) for a foreign address.

    "question": "Few bugs your developer should look on",
    "answer": "Sonam_Jha (Sonam Jha) 6 June 2022 17:36 1 Actually few bugs I want to report. At the time of logging the biometric doesn‚Äôt work. Everytime I do biometric it fails and I have to use MPin. So that should not happen. As I use phone pay, gpay. This issue never occurred. So the three factor authentication your developers are using have a bug. The solution for this is try to make the authentication factor better till than don‚Äôt give biometric option. Because it‚Äôs not user friendly. Most important one when I do scan and pay option and I give access to all the permission it get exited from the app. So this should not happen while doing payment. So you need to test it properly before making things to go live on production. That‚Äôs all. Overall it‚Äôs okay. 5 Likes",

    "question": "How financial planning can help you reach self-actualization",
    "answer": "Angana_S (Angana Sripur) 25 November 2020 16:03 1 Originally published at: How financial planning can help you reach self-actualization > Jupiter Hypothesis: Money buys us things Corollary: Money buys us the privilege to chase things other than money If you‚Äôve watched the Netflix show Maniac, chances are that you‚Äôll read that in Justin Theroux‚Äôs low toned voice. No, Justin Theroux didn‚Äôt talk about money and its role in our lives, but eight months into the lockdown and we at Jupiter have gotten increasingly introspective about it. After all, we are building tools to help you navigate your equation with money, and eventually with yourself. Think about the quest to attain ‚Äòself-actualization‚Äô. Maslow1920√ó1024 33.2 KB When you‚Äôre at the bottom of this pyramid, most questions you‚Äôre going to ask about yourself are going to end with ‚Äòmoney‚Äô. To be able to ask yourself questions like ‚ÄòWho am I if money doesn‚Äôt motivate my choices?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat do I really want if I have everything I need?‚Äô, you need to be able to build a life that doesn‚Äôt revolve around thinking about money woes right from the time you‚Äôre up brushing your teeth. If this seems like one of those moments where your friend has gone too far with their philosophical train of thought (and you, the practical friend has to tell them to can it), it is. We‚Äôre pulling ourselves back a little to think about a practical answer to this profound soliloquy. The answer seems to jump out quite plainly: Financial planning. Before you think this is an insincere segue into a rather hack-ey matter, hear us out. This isn‚Äôt one of those magical ‚ÄòGet rich before you retire‚Äô articles that claim that your financial plan will ensure that you end up living a life straight out of a ‚ÄòDream home in the hills‚Äô catalog. It‚Äôs a practical guide to the various ways in which you can start thinking about financial planning, and have it be less daunting than the first time you had to learn C++ in computer class (fine maybe that‚Äôs just me). So we‚Äôre going to start with the good news: It‚Äôs 2020. Ehm, no we‚Äôre not advocating for this catastrophe of a year. The good news is that it‚Äôs 2020 so you‚Äôre basically living at the peak of modern banking innovation. This means you have more tools at your disposal to execute a solid financial plan than your parents did to make their garden look better. Modern banking will help you get there faster Let‚Äôs circle back to our philosophical deliberation. The journey to attain self-actualization, or in fact any form of self-improvement starts with self-awareness. This is you gathering data about yourself as a person, your behavioral mechanisms, coping habits, traumas, etc. Without this knowledge, it‚Äôs impossible to proceed to the next step. Quite, in the same way, the first step to planning your finances is collating all your data. You can do it on a good ol‚Äô spreadsheet. Simply throw in everything you know about your finances, such as your income and expenditure, savings, investments, debts, etc. Remember, this is pure data. You don‚Äôt have to do any thinking, just open up your banking apps and dump the numbers on a sheet. Once you have this data in front of you, the rest is pretty straightforward. You split your financial planning into three buckets: 1. Spend management You know this thing where the Japanese have kinda cute names for everything, and that makes it much more fun to read about? Turns out they have one for budgeting too, it‚Äôs called Kakeibo. Kakeibo is the concept of keeping a ‚Äòbudgeting journal‚Äô (ties in all too well with this whole self-actualization theme we have going on here). If you‚Äôre reading this and going ‚ÄúWho keeps a written journal in 2020?!‚Äù then we‚Äôre right with you on that one. All we want to do is extract the core philosophy from this Japanese method which is ‚Äòsaving money is about spending money well.‚Äô Damn right it is. It might be worth considering the percentage of your monthly income you spend, and how much of that is spent on different expense buckets. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôd classify those: Non-discretionary expenses‚Äì such as bills and fixed monthly payments. These include rent, EMIs, grocery, mobile bills, essentials like water and electricity charges, daily commute, etc. We suggest optimizing these with a simple trick: Cut down on daily or monthly expenses which could lead to long-term gains. Like canceling subscriptions that you don‚Äôt use actively, getting a cheaper DTH plan, or carpooling to work instead of driving alone. Discretionary exp",

Some apps have good features. One of them is a better home Screen Widget. Currently the app only has a QR Scanner widget and nothing else and there is a lot of potential here. One that I would love to have is a wide networth Bar with a Aggregate Overview displayed. The app already has a networth indicator inside the it in the ‚ÄúMoney Tab => Networth‚Äù section If it was possible to have a financial overview dashboard widget, it would be amazing. And the app also has Multiple Bank Account Linking feature that shows all balances together. Even a simple 3√ó3 Table of [ Net Worth ] [ Received | Spend | Invested ] [ Accounts (s)Balance | Asset | Liability ] would be amazing. I can see how some people would not want to show actual financial numbers openly, so it could also have a option to disable Money Value and just have bars, graphs and arrows to indicate them. Even other stuff but I really think some better widgets could be great. 1 Like",

    "answer": "anoop (Anoop Chauhan) 1 March 2023 06:03 1 Hi everyone, Problem statement Currently, I have around 2-3 credit cards and 1-2 debit cards which I generally used for my all expenditures but I can‚Äôt track my all expenses in one place. I have to check all the cards statement individually to track my expenses, which is not that easy to use. there is one more problem I carry these all cards in my wallet and if any chance I lost my wallet I have to block and re-apply for all the cards again. Expected Solution If there is an app that gives us a card which is work as a single card for all the debit and credit cards. From the app, we will be able to add debit/credit cards and switch cards to use. It will help to track all the transactions in one place and if we lost the card there is only one card which we have to block and re-apply. Internationally there is one company which is already doing this (https://www.curve.com/) is there a possibility to do the same in the Indian market? 2 Likes",

    "question": "How to decide if the RBI moratorium works for you",
    "answer": "Chirag_Heda (Chirag Heda) 10 July 2020 11:10 1 Originally published at: https://blog.jupiter.money/2020/04/covid-19-should-you-take-the-emi-moratorium/ It‚Äôs week three of SIMS 2020 the lockdown and some of us are enjoying the perks ‚Äì more time at home, lesser laundry, ‚Äúhouse parties‚Äù, and almost zero traffic. Some gifts though, are a little more surprising. Like the RBI allowing you to not pay off your loans for the next 3 months! In fact, your typically slow and spammy bank probably wrote to you immediately saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúpleased to extend you this service gesture.‚Äù Praise the Lord! Ah, but there‚Äôs more to the RBI moratorium than meets the eye. This is simply a grace period ‚Äì a deferment of payments ‚Äì not a waiver. Here‚Äôs what that means. Out of the frying pan, into the fire To help cope with the sudden & unexpected impact of the pandemic, the RBI directed financial institutions (banks, credit card companies, NBFCs) to offer a three-month moratorium on EMIs. While this short-term measure can ease cash flow without impacting their credit score, its long-term implications are less obvious. You know why ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch‚Äù? Because there‚Äôs no such thing as free money. While the banks will not collect EMIs, they will, however, add the unpaid interest in this period back to the principal. This means that while you won‚Äôt pay anything for the 3 months, your outstanding loan amount will be higher after the moratorium, which in turn means either a longer loan duration or higher EMIs for the remainder of the loan period. Yooouuu can‚Äôt deny that the numbers don‚Äôt lie üé∂ Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre buying an iPhone 11 Pro on a loan: Rs.1,00,000 @ 30% interest for 6 months and EMI of Rs.18,155. Total payment due is 18155 * 6 = Rs 1,08,930 You haven‚Äôt started paying EMIs yet and are considering opting for the moratorium If you take the moratorium, you wouldn‚Äôt need to pay anything for 3 months. But interest will accrue at the same 30% and get added to your loan principal. This means that when you do resume payments, you would have to pay ~Rs 9000 more over the loan period ‚Äì 8% higher than what you had initially signed up for! Bottom line: That iPhone is going to make you feel more üò≠and less üòÅ Remember, the moratorium only serves as a cash flow relief and not an interest relief. If you‚Äôre cash-crunched, this facility could offer temporary respite. But if you have the money, you should continue paying your EMIs. Don‚Äôt let temporary relief right now increase your burden later! ‚ÄúWhat about my credit card bil‚Äî.‚Äù ‚ÄúOMG NO!‚Äù Seriously. Don‚Äôt even think about using the moratorium for your credit card! Because the higher the interest rate, the higher the moratorium‚Äôs adverse impact. And the interest rates on credit cards are too damn high ‚Äì an eye-watering 3-4% a month. We actually have a whole video explaining this, right here. Deferring your credit card bills for 2 months could mean cumulative interest upwards of 6-8%. Plus, purchases during the next 2 months would attract interest too. Cherry on the cake ‚Äì you will then be charged interest on the unpaid interest. Let‚Äôs break down the numbers: Detail Amount (in Rs) 1 April bill (for March purchases) 30,000 2 April purchases 25,000 3 Interest on unbilled amount ‚Äì April (@ 3% on 1+2) 1650 4 May bill (for unbilled April amount 1+2+3) 56,650 5 May purchases 22,500 6 Interest on unbilled amount ‚Äì May (@ 3% on 4+5) 2375 7 Jun bill (for unbilled May amount 4+5+6) 81,525 Additional interest paid on account of availing the moratorium (3+6) 4,025 If you‚Äôre cash-strapped and unable to pay your credit card bills, we recommend that you: Convert the outstanding amount into EMIs, or Take a personal loan to settle the bill While neither of these options is cheap or ideal, they are significantly better than rolling over the entire credit card bill for 2 months. Sometimes, things may not be that simple Maybe credit card bills are the least of your worries. If the pandemic has you assessing what EMIs to defer under the moratorium, don‚Äôt worry, we have answers. Take Mr. A. He makes Rs.1 lakh per month (after tax) and has two loans on: An iPhone loan (Rs.1,00,000 @ 30% interest for 6 months; EMI = Rs.18,155) A home loan (Rs.40,00,000 @ 10% interest for 20 years; EMI = Rs.38,601) For simplicity, let‚Äôs assume neither of the payments has begun yet. Sure, as a percentage of his income, his EMIs are pretty high. But Mr. A wasn‚Äôt deterred, thanks to his steady, well-paying job. Besides, the iPhone loan was o",

    "answer": "sahil-sorathiya (Sahil Sorathiya) 28 July 2020 07:40 1 I personally started using One Card 2-3 days before. Thought all the feedback in one place will be of help. So here is my feedback on the product. Please feel free to post your feedback on one card. Why did I install it? Was curious on their rewards (didn‚Äôt have clarity on when I got the card and still I am not 100% clear about it) and heard about it a lot from office folks / friends / etc Wanted to reduce my forex fee (which is super high from all the crowdfunding that I keep doing. I used my HDFC regalia card which is expensive in forex: 2-3.5% in forex fee) Experience so far: Onboarding: (5/5) Clean onboarding (they fetched the communication address from my credit bureau report but the address were old so had to update a new address - but nice attempt to reduce the friction on onboarding) No address proof required for delivery (I had it delivered at Bangalore address while being at my home town and working in Mumbai) Had a virtual account ready in a few minutes Rewards: (2/5) No clarity on how the reward points are awarded No clarity on how to redeem the reward points First time I paid my bill on airtel via airtel bank - no credit points were awarded and then later came to know that wallet transactions yield no rewards - I was disappointed in that flow. Since I just installed, and haven‚Äôt transacted on 3 different categories of merchants (which I have no clue what they are) - their rewards point program of 5X rewards in top 2 categories is not applicable for me yet. App: (2/5) Good visualization of the outstanding and available limit Next statement generated in X days - this is helpful but confusing to know whats the billing date cycle here. They use merchant names (thank god for this) in the transaction list not the code of that Merchant so you can easily know where you spent the money at least. Some weird flows like redeeming the rewards bit (where they said swipe the transaction which I don‚Äôt understand and nor is my first instinct - this is bad for users) Security-related inside the app: One issue is that while opening at home page it shows cvv and validity which is bad bad bad - what if I am opening the app for something else - why would they expose those sensitive information in wide open. How is your experience on One Card so far? Please post detailed comments by replying to this post. very satisfied somewhat satisfied not satisfied 0 voters 6 Likes",

    "question": "The future of retail banking is not just digital",
    "answer": "Angana_S (Angana Sripur) 25 January 2021 06:11 1 Originally published at: The future of retail banking is not just digital > Jupiter Up until the 20th century, banks had a fairly elementary role in people‚Äôs lives: They stored money and lent money. Their business model remained fairly simple and so did consumers‚Äô relationships with their banks. Today, people have a much more nuanced dynamic with their retail banking system, and banks too are starting to recognise that they‚Äôll have to go beyond their role as just storage lockers and lending entities, and understand non-financial aspects of their consumers‚Äô life if they wish to thrive. Banks are not only going to need to act as a trusted advisor of all things money but also reach all touchpoints of a person‚Äôs financial journey and provide tangential services to stay relevant in the current ecosystem. To do this, banks have started to adopt cutting-edge technology so they can offer more personalised services, improved payments, and participate in the current digital revolution. They‚Äôve started to engage in purposeful collaboration and technological innovation, to usher in the next phase of banking that‚Äôs not just digital but also digitised- Enter Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is simply a network of interconnected digital devices to exchange data. From temperature controls and lighting to fleet management and security devices there are billions of IoT devices coming into use around the world right now. For retail banking, this is an especially important innovation to invest in because of the amount of personalisation it will enable. Retail banking will use IoT to achieve personalization at scale Let‚Äôs back up a little to the hypothesis we made above: People not only want their banks to help them spend and save better, but they also want their banks to aid them to make better financial decisions. A feat that banks can achieve only through extreme personalisation, at scale. They‚Äôll need to make use of open APIs and marketplace technologies to connect banking services with homes, wearables, smartphones, vehicles, and other devices. So what does retail banking IoT look like for the foreseeable future? Contactless ATMs ‚Äì This is the next banking innovation on the horizon right now. With mobile payments on the rise, banks will start allowing you to withdraw cash or use ATM services with their smartphones via codes and OTPs. An extension of IoT ATMs will be that the ATMs connected to an app will use location data to help consumers find the nearest one. Funky wearables ‚Äì From smartwatches to jewelry and smart glasses to tattoos, wearable tech is all set to transform the way companies interact with you. This is especially true in the case of retail banking, where wearables can eliminate the need for passwords by using biometric authentication and eliminate the need for people to remember multiple passwords- a major grouse that a lot of people currently have with the digital banking system. Wearables are also going to revamp the meaning of ‚Äòcustomer care‚Äô. Take for instance the idea of voice chatbots in smart earphones that can answer your queries. Banks will start investing in creating UX that‚Äôs optimized for such devices. Smart gadgets ‚Äì With a gamut of banking innovations coming up, this one is seriously interesting. Think about home appliances; what if you could set limits on their usage to reduce electricity bills? Like a device that alerts you when you‚Äôve gone beyond your AC-usage limit for the month and helps you cut down spending. Amazon already has a ‚ÄòDash program‚Äô that allows devices to be connected to Amazon accounts. When the device needs to be replaced it signals that a payment needs to be made, like when it‚Äôs time to replace your electric toothbrush. Another IoT smart gadget to look out for is home speakers that allow opening bank accounts, checking balances, and paying credit card bills (‚ÄúAlexa, open a bank account for me and make sure I‚Äôm never broke‚Äù). This technology can also be used if you‚Äôve lost your card or need billing reminders. Most companies are building payment options directly into the app of their IoT devices. Bluetooth beacons ‚Äì With 5G being the new rage, bluetooth beacons that connect with smart devices to perform specific actions are on the rise. How can retail banking take advantage of this? Quick, automated, and contactless payments of course! Think about auto-serve at your local Starbucks, pub, or restaurant as you‚Äôre reaching the location becaus",

    "question": "Offers and Rewards Section",
    "answer": "SPOFFICEAL (SP) 19 February 2025 17:25 1 Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how Jupiter could improve its UPI app experience, focusing on dedicated offers and cashback, and how to frame these suggestions as requests to Jupiter: I. Enhancing Offers and Cashback within Jupiter UPI Dedicated ‚ÄúOffers & Rewards‚Äù Section: Instead of burying offers within transaction history or relying on push notifications, create a prominent ‚ÄúOffers & Rewards‚Äù section within the UPI app. This section should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and clearly categorize offers. Personalized Offers: Leverage Jupiter‚Äôs data analysis to provide personalized offers based on user transaction patterns. For example: Frequent grocery shoppers get cashback on supermarket UPI transactions. Users who often pay for food delivery get discounts on partner restaurants. Utilize user location data to provide local merchant offers. Tiered Cashback/Rewards System: Implement a tiered system where users earn more rewards based on their UPI transaction volume or frequency. This could include: Base cashback on all UPI transactions. Bonus cashback for hitting monthly transaction goals. Exclusive offers for high-volume users. Partner Merchant Offers: Forge partnerships with popular online and offline merchants to offer exclusive UPI cashback and discounts. Promote these partnerships prominently within the ‚ÄúOffers & Rewards‚Äù section. Gamification: Introduce gamified elements like: ‚ÄúStreaks‚Äù for consecutive daily UPI transactions. ‚ÄúChallenges‚Äù to earn bonus rewards. ‚ÄúSpin the wheel‚Äù or scratch card options for random rewards. Clear and Transparent Cashback Tracking: Provide a clear and real-time view of earned cashback and rewards within the app. Ensure easy redemption of cashback to the user‚Äôs Jupiter account. Inform the user of expiring offer and cashback. II. Framing Requests to Jupiter Here‚Äôs how you can phrase your suggestions as constructive requests to Jupiter: Subject: Enhancing Jupiter UPI with a Dedicated Offers & Rewards Section Body: ‚ÄúDear Jupiter Team, I‚Äôm a loyal Jupiter user and I appreciate the convenience of your UPI feature. To further enhance the user experience, I‚Äôd like to suggest the implementation of a dedicated ‚ÄòOffers & Rewards‚Äô section within the Jupiter UPI app.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis section could feature personalized offers, partner merchant discounts, and a tiered cashback system, making it more engaging for users.‚Äù ‚ÄúSpecifically, I would like to request that you consider the following:‚Äù ‚ÄúCreating a visually appealing ‚ÄòOffers & Rewards‚Äô tab.‚Äù ‚ÄúImplementing personalized offers based on transaction history and location.‚Äù ‚ÄúDeveloping a tiered cashback system to incentivize frequent UPI usage.‚Äù ‚ÄúPartnering with popular merchants to provide exclusive UPI offers.‚Äù ‚ÄúAdding gamification elements to make rewards more engaging.‚Äù ‚ÄúProviding clear and transparent cashback tracking and redemption.‚Äù ‚ÄúAdding a system that notifies users of expiring offers and cashback.‚Äù ‚ÄúI believe these improvements would significantly increase user engagement and make Jupiter UPI an even more valuable tool.

    "question": "How the COVID-19 lockdown can help you build your emergency fund",
    "answer": "aniket (Aniket Tamboli) 3 July 2020 05:15 1 Originally published at: https://blog.jupiter.money/2020/04/how-the-covid-19-lockdown-can-help-you-build-your-emergency-fund/ The 21-day lockdown imposed in light of the Coronavirus pandemic has seriously impacted how we go about our lives. We aren‚Äôt just talking about how we (try to) work from home or (desperately try to) get household chores done. We‚Äôre talking about how it has affected our money and financial priorities. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never tried this cereal, but give me 6 boxes‚Äù First, our spending patterns have changed significantly. Staying-in and panic-driven hoarding has increased spends on groceries and household supplies. At the same time, other areas have seen a sharp decline: Dining out or going to the pub seems like a distant dream The lack of Ubers and Olas on the streets feels like a throwback to early-2010s and The inability to shop at high-street outlets or on your phone takes us back even further Second, the changes are also psychological ‚Äì we‚Äôre suddenly thinking about contingency plans and pondering uncertainties. Would my life be easier right now if I‚Äôd saved up more? Could I be staring in the face of higher medical expenses? What do I do if I have to take a pay-cut or worse, lose my job? ‚Ä¶what if both of those happen together? It‚Äôs fair that we wonder about where our lives are headed, but now‚Äôs a good time to ask another question: Can all these changes help me build an emergency fund? To answer this, we mapped out the changed spend pattern for a household that makes Rs 1,00,000 after taxes: Before After Change Take home salary 100000 100000 0% Expenses Housing & Utilities 25000 25000 0% Transport 4000 400 -90% Food & household supplies 10000 11500 +15% Eating out, shopping & entertainment 10000 3000 -70% Loans & misc. expenses 15000 14000 -7% Savings 36000 46100 +28% Want to see how much your own expenses have changed? We have an Excel sheet to help you do just that! Download it here ‚ÄúExcuse me waiter, there‚Äôs extra soup in my bowl.‚Äù The sharp decrease in expenses such as dining out and transport far outweigh the increasing spends on grocery and supplies. The result? Savings can shoot up by over 30%. Sure, the above example is anecdotal, but there‚Äôs a high chance that this lockdown could boost your savings just as significantly. You can edit the sheet above to determine what this situation means for you. Just key in your expenses as they were and how they‚Äôve changed now, and voila! See these lemons? *poof!* Lemonade! To put things in perspective: Over just 3 months, the reduced expenses during this ‚Äúnon-normal‚Äù could add up to savings worth one full month! But the big question is: What should you do with these additional savings? Letting them accumulate in your savings account might not be wise. Because lockdown or not, we all know money finds a way to get spent when it‚Äôs directly accessible. We‚Äôll dive deep into the investment opportunities in a separate blog, but to begin with ‚Äì these savings are best added to an emergency fund that will help you tide over any crises, emergencies or unpleasant surprises resulting from this pandemic. While you could stash this money in a secondary bank account or recurring deposit, we recommend that you invest in liquid funds to optimise your returns while maintaining sufficient liquidity. That way, in case of an emergency, the money‚Äôs easy to get to while still having grown (no matter how little). You can view top-performing schemes here. This once-in-a-generation event (we‚Äôre now part of a future history lesson, people!) has certainly emphasised the need to build an emergency fund. But just as significantly, it has also given us an opportunity to build a cushion for times to come. Let‚Äôs make the most of it. Stay safe and stay covered, everyone! 5 Likes",

But If I consider Jupiter as a sole UPI app then I hate to admit that It‚Äôs totally laggy with outdated and clumpy UI as compared to other UPI apps. So, it‚Äôs difficult to use as daily basis UPI app. My suggestions: Simplify app UI. Give an option to edit UPI id. Decrease font Size in the app. Home section should be options for Pay to mobile, Transfer, Balance check, History. Invest section should be clutter free. Loan section is good bdw. Upi lite. 4 Likes",

    "question": "Reduce Your Tax Liability Beyond Section 80C | Jupiter",
    "answer": "JupiterTeam (Jupiter Team) 30 September 2021 03:36 1 Like most taxpayers, you may know about the tax benefit of ‚Çπ1.5 lakhs available under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The investment options under this section include employee provident fund (EPF), public provident fund (PPF), life insurance premium, tax-saving fixed deposits, and many more. However, apart from these, there are various other investment options that can help reduce your tax liability. Read on to know about other ways to save taxes. Deductions under section 80D Health insurance premium Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provides tax benefits on medical insurance. Under this section, premium paid for purchasing health insurance for self, spouse, dependent children, and parents is eligible for tax deduction. The maximum deduction that can be claimed depends on the members covered under the policy and their age. Moreover, tax deduction of up to ‚Çπ5,000 is available for health check-up expenses for self or family. Medical expenses for a disabled dependent Section 80DD exempts any expenses related to the treatment of disabled dependents. Some of these include training, nursing, and rehabilitation of dependents. This deduction is available to individual and Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) taxpayers. Treatment for specified diseases Under section 80DDB, individual and HUF taxpayers may claim deductions on expenses incurred for treating certain specified diseases. Some of these include neurological disorders like dementia, Parkinson‚Äôs, ataxia, and motor neuron ailments; hematological ailments like hemophilia and thalassemia; renal failure, and malignant cancers. The deduction limit under section 80DDB is as follows: If the age of the person undergoing medical treatment is less than 60 years, they may claim ‚Çπ40,000 or actual incurred expenses for the treatment, whichever is lower. Senior citizens aged over 60 years may claim ‚Çπ1 lakh or actual incurred expenses for the treatment, whichever is lower. Repayment of education loan (section 80E) Under section 80E, interest paid on education loan availed for self, spouse, or any student for whom you act as a legal guardian is eligible for tax deduction. You can claim the benefit for seven years from the year you begin loan repayment, or until the entire interest is paid, whichever is earlier. However, the deduction can be claimed only if the loan is taken for pursuing higher education from an approved lender and not from relatives, friends, or family members. Interest payment on a home loan (section 24) If you have availed of a home loan, you can claim a tax deduction on the interest component of the equated monthly installment (EMI) under section 24. The loan must be on a self-occupied property, and the maximum deduction is limited to ‚Çπ2 lakhs per year. On the other hand, if the loan is taken for a rented or deemed to be rented property, there is no maximum limit on the tax deduction. Therefore, you can claim the entire interest as a tax deduction. Interest payment on a home loan for first-time homebuyers (section 80EE) First-time homebuyers can claim tax deductions of ‚Çπ50,000 under section 80EE of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This is in addition to the interest deduction of ‚Çπ2 lakhs available under section 24. However, the property value should be less than ‚Çπ50 lakhs and the home loan amount cannot exceed ‚Çπ35 lakhs. Interest paid on loan availed for an electric vehicle (section 80EEB) Under section 80EEB, you can claim tax deductions of up to ‚Çπ1.50 lakhs if you have availed of finance to buy an electric vehicle. To be eligible for this benefit, the loan should be taken between 1st April 2019 and 31st March 2023. Rent paid for accommodation (section 80GG) Another tax-saving option is available under section 80GG. If you are a salaried individual but do not receive house rent allowance (HRA) or if you are self-employed, you can claim rent paid as tax deduction. The maximum limit is ‚Çπ60,000 and is not available if you live in a rented house in the same city where you own a house. Additionally, if you claim interest deduction under section 24, this tax benefit is not available. Interest received from savings bank account (section 80TTA) Section 80TTA provides taxpayers with another income tax-saving option on the interest earned on their savings accounts. The maximum benefit available is capped at ‚Çπ10,000 per year. Interest earned from deposits in case of senior citizens (section 80TTB) Section 80TTB offers ta",

    "question": "Busting the myth of solo genius: Why we built a community of people to co-create our product",
    "answer": "Angana_S (Angana Sripur) 24 August 2020 18:30 1 Originally published at: Busting the myth of solo genius: Why we built a community of people to co-create our product > Jupiter I want you to perform a small exercise in your free time (please don‚Äôt abandon my blog post in this pursuit because what I have to say next is intriguing, to say the least). Here goes: Open your search bar. Search for the term ‚ÄòBanking co-creation‚Äô. Chances are that you will be met with an insipid results page with incomprehensible terms such as framework determinants, co-profiting, and jumping into your neighbor‚Äôs pool. We bet you didn‚Äôt even notice that last part because of how boring that sentence was. Back in 2016, Forbes made a striking declaration ‚ÄòCustomer co-creation is the secret sauce to success‚Äô. This doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise, considering major brands like LEGO and IKEA have been embracing co-creation concepts for the last two decades. From origami experiments to food toppings and stuffed animals to video editing software, co-creation really did seem to be setting a creative exemplar for businesses. Cut to 2020 and we have co-created cities (Rajneeshpuram anyone?), brands, TV commercials, global supply chains, and healthcare startups. This makes it astonishing that banking co-creation is nowhere in the offing. Most companies have used this insight to host hackathons, launch special projects, and experiment with their new initiatives. At Jupiter, we took this up a notch. Altering the course of banking Ask anyone in India about their grouse with the current banking system and their answer won‚Äôt surprise you any more than that family member you‚Äôve never met who wishes to see you in holy matrimony- One doesn‚Äôt ever feel truly heard. From dismal customer experiences to indecipherable bank statements, the current closed-door system indicates that our banks just aren‚Äôt listening to us. Our mandate was thus clear, build a banking experience that works for you. To do this we took a product development approach that keeps users at its centre. Our community shapes our product at every step of the product journey and forms the synthesis of our brand. So much so, that our product roadmap is pretty much built by you. When you have a community-first product approach, co-creation isn‚Äôt just a marketing gimmick, it‚Äôs about really creating value. It‚Äôs about diving into the nuances of every single thought that our members have put out there. It‚Äôs about deliberation and reflection on how we can take your brainchild and turn it into a useful product feature. Starting with deep discourse One of the earliest thoughts on our community forum talked about the need to be able to see one‚Äôs ‚ÄòTrue balance‚Äô ‚Äì your month-end balance after removing all upcoming fixed expenses. What a strikingly useful suggestion! If you‚Äôve been part of the Indian banking system for long enough, chances are that you‚Äôve gone through another agony‚Äì ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt I see all of my banking fees and charges upfront?‚Äô We all know that finding these charges feels harder than if one played legends of the Hidden Temple (90‚Äôs kids will get it). Another relatable conversation we were having was about the need for a ‚ÄòFinancial wellness score‚Äò. Like a credit score, but one that‚Äôs a lot more holistic. Or this honest advertising thread, a summary of our gripe with banking institutions since forever. (This specific concern makes us at Jupiter, take our fine print very seriously*). Our community forum enables members to be able to air their collective anguish, and build a support system of people who care about the same things. A forum that helps us create mutual value, and find solutions that benefit the community and us, while we ensure the equitable distribution of this value. We maintain homogeneity of vision and heterogeneity of experiences ( David V√©lez, founder of Nubank mentioned this is an important pillar of a business). This is probably the most lucid way to summarise why community co-creation makes our product finer. It allows us to accommodate different perspectives from people of various backgrounds and needs, and make well-informed decisions based on these diverse criteria. Creating intrinsic rewards We live in a culture where economic value is considered the cornerstone of happiness, whereas successful co-creation creates intrinsic value in the form of rewarding experiences. Products designed to provide a superior experience and reduce one‚Äôs pain points seem like a far better proposition",

Here‚Äôs everything you need to know, and the factors that could affect markets in the coming days. 1. Sensex & Nifty At open, the Sensex was down ~1,274 points or 1.57 percent at ~79,708, and the Nifty was down 378 points or 1.53 percent at ~24,340. 2. Tepid Q1 show For the 30 Nifty 50 companies that have reported their earnings so far, there is a 0.7 percent year on year growth but a 9.4 percent QoQ decline in net profits. The aggregate performance was hit by a sharp drag from global commodities. 3. Fear of US Recession The US experienced a massive hiring slowdown in July (adding only 1,14,000 jobs monthly VS 2,15,000 monthly jobs monthly last year). Additionally, unemployment has jumped to around 4.3 percent - the highest since October 2021. 4. Iran-Israel tensions Tensions in the Middle East surge as Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah promise to retaliate against Israel‚Äôs assassination of Hamas chief. Escalation in the Middle East may send oil prices surging. 5. Yen Reverse Trade The Bank of Japan‚Äôs decision to raise interest rates has driven the Yen to its strongest value against the US dollar since March. Increased interest rates may prompt Japanese traders to sell securities they hold in world markets. How‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs portfolio doing? Let us know in the thread below! @trust_level_0 1 Like",

    "question": "How Do Loans Work?",
    "answer": "What Is UAN and How Do You Generate It Online?August 27, 2024What is PPF Account? Eligibility Criteria, Steps to ApplyAugust 27, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Today, it is common to avail of a loan to purchase things that you cannot otherwise afford like a home or a car. When used responsibly, loans can be quite beneficial. However, if you are not careful, you may end up in financial difficulties and a debt trap. What is a loan? Loans comprise three components, which include the borrowed amount also known as the principal, the rate of interest, and the repayment tenure. When you borrow money from any lender like a bank or a non-banking financial company (NBFC), you agree to repay the principal along with the interest over the loan tenure. Read on to know everything about this credit facility. How do loans work? Having understood what a loan is, let us now understand how it works. When you borrow money, you need to not only return the principal but also pay the interest on it. When you avail of a loan, you have to repay the money in equated monthly installments (EMIs). The EMI comprises the principal and the interest components. During the initial loan tenure, the interest component is higher. However, as you continue paying the EMIs, a majority of the installment goes towards principal repayment. Therefore, it is recommended to repay the loan early to reduce the total interest outflow during the tenure. Different types of loans Financial institutions offer different types of loans, which can be classified as follows: Based on assets Gold loansThese are available by pledging gold jewelry or coins or bars. Based on the weight and purity of the gold, the lender will offer the principal amount, which can be used for any purpose.Gold loans are repaid in monthly installments and if you fail to make payments on time, the lender reserves the right to take charge of the gold to recover the outstanding balance. Other assetsYou may avail of a loan against other assets like fixed deposits (FDs), mutual funds, bonds, shares, and insurance policies.The loan amount depends on the value of the pledged asset after deducting some margin. Failure to repay the loan on time can result in losing your asset. Based on purpose Home loansYou may use the borrowed amount to purchase a completed property or build a home. These types of bank loans can also be used for home repairs or renovations.The lender will create a mortgage on the property and the ownership will be transferred once you repay the entire borrowed amount and the interest. Personal loansIf you require emergency funds, you may apply for personal finance. There is no limitation on how the money can be used.Moreover, the loan amount depends on your relationship with the lender and your credit score. Education loansStudent loans allow you to pursue education from a reliable university or institute. The lenders approve your application only if you are eligible for international or domestic studies and have an admission confirmation letter. Vehicle loansYou may buy a new or a used car or two-wheeler with vehicle loans. The amount depends on the price of the vehicle, and you may have to pay some amount as a down payment as most lenders do not sanction 100% of the price.Moreover, you will get ownership of the vehicle when the loan is repaid in full. Based on security Secured loans You will have to provide some collateral to avail of a secured loan. If you are not able to repay the loan, the lender can take charge of the security to recover the outstanding amount. Generally, secured finance is available at a low rate of interest. Unsecured loans Based on certain factors like your creditworthiness, past relationship with the lender, and income, the lenders may offer unsecured loans. Such loans do not require pledging any security; however, the interest rate can be higher than a secured loan. Who can get a loan facility? Some lenders may offer a loan only to existing customers while others may accept applications from all borrowers. Loans are available for salaried and self-employed individuals as well as companies. Eligibility criteria The eligibility criteria vary from one financial institution to another and also differ based on the type of loan. However, some of the basic eligibility criteria are as follows: Credit scoreThis is an important factor that determines your loan eligibility.

    "question": "Best Ways to Invest in Digital Gold Online",
    "answer": "What is RuPay Credit Card? Benefits, Types, and How to ApplyJuly 28, 2024What is CIBIL Score? All You Need to Know about CIBIL ScoreJuly 29, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle We Indians love gold and are obsessed with it. We include gold in all our festivals as it is considered the most auspicious purchase. Moreover, it is our go-to investment if we have excess money. This is mainly because gold is a store of wealth and has given good returns in the long term. It also acts as an excellent hedge against inflation and is a good alternative for diversifying our investment portfolio. While physical gold still dominates purchases, several alternatives, such as gold ETFs, sovereign bonds, and digital gold, are gaining traction. Let‚Äôs look at the different types of digital gold products and best ways to invest in digital gold online. Different Types of Digital Gold Products There are so many digital gold products available in the market that eliminate the hassle of storing gold physically. Moreover, there wouldn‚Äôt be any problem with purity as all digital gold products are backed by the highest purity of gold. The best part about purchasing digital gold is that you need not worry about theft as the purchase is stored in digital form. With this in mind, let‚Äôs look at the best way to invest in digital gold online. Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Gold ETFs are mutual funds that invest in gold bullion. These funds track the price of physical gold and hence are one of the most popular digital gold alternatives. One unit of the gold ETF equals one gram of gold which is backed by physical gold of the highest purity. So, when you buy units of gold ETF, it means you are purchasing gold, but not physically. They trade on the stock exchange and can be purchased and sold just like stocks using a demat account. When you sell your investment in a gold ETF, you do not get physical gold. Instead, you will get the equivalent value of cash. Investing in gold ETFs is not only simple but also inexpensive. They charge a very low expense ratio and are very liquid. Gold mutual funds Another alternative to investing in physical gold is gold mutual funds. They invest directly or indirectly in mutual funds. Direct investment is in gold bullion, while indirect investment is in stocks of gold mining companies or gold ETFs. They are open-ended mutual funds and can be purchased and sold anytime. You don‚Äôt need a demat account to invest in them, and they can be purchased directly from the fund house or any online mutual fund platform. They are also quite liquid, and you can sell them immediately to get back your investment proceeds. The best part about investing in gold mutual funds is that you can invest with an amount as low as Rs 500 and schedule a SIP (systematic investment plan) to invest a certain amount every month. They charge a small fee called expense ratio which will help cover the expenses of managing the fund. Since the expense ratio is deducted from the profits, choosing a fund with a low expense ratio and consistency in performance is important. Gold futures contracts Gold futures are standardized contracts where the buyer of the contract agrees to take delivery of gold of a predetermined price and quantity on a future date. When the contract expires, the buyer and the seller have to honour the contract at either profit or loss. The buyer or seller can buy, sell or hold the contract before the date of expiry. In India, gold futures trade on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX). Gold futures fall under the high-risk category of gold investing. Hence it is suitable only for high-risk mature investors. Sovereign gold bonds (SGB) The government of India issues gold bonds through the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). SGBs are issued against grams of gold. The minimum investment is one gram, and the maximum investment is 4 kgs. They pay a fixed interest of 2.5% per annum and also offer the benefits of price appreciation. So, when you decide to sell your investment in SGBs, you will get the market price of gold. You can sell it at the end of eight years when the bond expires (after eight years), or you can sell it prematurely. However, you can only sell it prematurely in the secondary market after the fifth year. If you sell the bonds before eight years, the capital gains are subject to tax. If you sell the bonds after maturity, the capital gains are tax-free. However, the interest is taxable when ",

With the extra money, you can consider living a debt-free life by foreclosing your loan and saving up on the extra interest you would‚Äôve had to pay with the EMIs. Loan foreclosure is the complete and final repayment of your remaining loan in a single payment, instead of paying smaller portions every month with interest. But, how do you compute the remaining amount you need to pay to foreclose your loan? Here‚Äôs where a loan foreclosure calculator comes into the picture. With loan foreclosures, banks lose the interest they would‚Äôve otherwise earned. Therefore, some banks charge a specific interest (around 4%) as foreclosure charges for closing your loan in advance. However, to avoid the hefty interest charges every month, this is a small amount to pay to avoid the hefty interest charges. Based on a few details of your loan, you can quickly compute the foreclosure charges and determine the exact amount you need to pay for the foreclosure of your loan. Loan foreclosure calculators can help you understand how much you‚Äôll need to pay today to end your loan and how much interest you will be saving. How is the foreclosure amount calculated? You will need to enter the following details in your : The pending loan amount The loan tenure ‚Äì in months or years The applicable rate of interest (per year) The total number of EMIs you have already paid The month in which you wish to foreclosure the loan. For example, if you use a car loan foreclosure calculator to repay your car loan after five months, the month you foreclose will be 5. It is called the foreclosure month. If you prepay the loan after one year and seven months, your foreclosure month is 19 (12+7). Some calculators ask you how many EMIs you have paid to assess the foreclosure month. Any charges that your bank applies on the foreclosing of the loan. You can find it in your loan documents. Here are some loan foreclosure tips that will help you: These tips will come in handy when you begin your loan foreclosure planning and process. Contact your bank: Contact your bank‚Äôs customer care; It will help you address any concerns and enter the correct details into the personal loan foreclosure calculator or other loan foreclosure calculators. Keep your KYC handy and File an Application: Once you have used the foreclosure loan calculator and know how much you need to pay to foreclose the loan, apply with your bank to start the process. You might also have to submit your details like the PAN Card, Aadhaar Card and loan documents as part of the application, so keep them handy. Collect all documents: Don‚Äôt forget to collect these documents as proof of completing all loan repayments: Acknowledgement letter from the bank that you have repaid the entire loan No dues certificate from the bank stating that you don‚Äôt have to pay any more payments Pre-closure payment receipt for the final amount paid Loan closure and no objection certificate from the bank Don‚Äôt forget to stop all existing standing instructions and reminders for EMI repayments. Credit Scores: A good credit score gives you the option of better interest rates, better offers and rewards on cards, quicker approval on future loans, and many more benefits! By repaying the loan, your credit score is bound to increase. If it is not automatically updated, ensure to inform the credit rating agencies and enjoy the benefits of a high credit score. Understanding the loan foreclosure calculations and charges: The key to practical calculations ‚Äì Your loan documents Be it a personal loan or a home loan; your loan documents contain all the details required to effectively calculate the home loan foreclosure charges or other foreclosure charges.

For example, some home loans come with zero pre-closure charges if the home loan is paid after five yea",

    "question": "How PF Is Calculated? A Step-by-Step Guide",
    "answer": "Difference Between Direct and Regular Mutual FundsMay 25, 2023What is Investment Planning and Why is it Important?June 27, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Are you curious about how your retirement savings are calculated? Look no further! In this blog, we‚Äôll delve into the Employee Provident Fund (EPF), a retirement scheme designed to ensure sufficient funds for your retirement period. Regardless of whether you work in the private or government sector, you can take advantage of this scheme. Interestingly, nowadays, any company with a workforce exceeding 20 employees is required to sign up for the Provident Fund. Both employees and employers contribute to the fund, and in this article, we‚Äôll explore how PF is calculated on your monthly salary. So, let‚Äôs demystify PF calculation and get a better understanding of how PF is calculated! What Are the Components of PF Calculation? Basic Salary: This refers to the fixed portion of an employee‚Äôs compensation that forms the foundation for calculating PF contributions. Dearness Allowance (DA): DA in salary is an additional amount provided to employees to counter inflation and ensure their real income is maintained. It is also considered for PF calculation purposes. House Rent Allowance (HRA): HRA in salary is an allowance given to employees to cover their accommodation expenses. It is also included in the PF calculation. Conveyance Allowance: This allowance is given to employees to cover transportation expenses incurred during work-related travel. It is considered part of the PF calculation. Other Allowances and Special Pay: Apart from the aforementioned components, any other allowances or special pay received by employees that are subject to PF deductions will also be considered in the calculation. Exclusions from PF Calculation While the above components are included in PF calculation, there may be certain elements that are excluded, such as performance-based incentives, overtime pay, and reimbursements for medical expenses or travel allowances. Note: The provided information is for general understanding, and it is always advisable to consult the specific rules and regulations governing PF calculation in your region or organization. Divisions of Provident Fund Calculation The Provident Fund contribution is divided into two categories. Employee‚Äôs PF Contribution: For female employees, the contribution to their Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is set at 8% of their salary. However, this rate applies only for the initial 3 years of employment. After this period, the contribution percentage increases to 10-12% based on their base salary. Male employees, on the other hand, are required to contribute 8% of their overall salary to the EPF. Employer‚Äôs PF Contribution: Employers are obligated to contribute an equal amount to the EPF. This contribution is fixed at either 10% or 12% of the employee‚Äôs gross salary. It‚Äôs important to note that the contribution percentage remains unchanged for female employers. How PF is Calculated in India? Determining the amount of money be deposited into each employee‚Äôs Provident Fund (PF) account involves following certain rules. Typically, an employee‚Äôs PF account consists of two types of contributions: Employee‚Äôs contribution Employer‚Äôs contribution During PF calculation in an employee‚Äôs salary, the employee contributes 12% of their basic salary and dearness allowance (DA) each month to the Provident Fund. Additionally, the employer matches the employee‚Äôs contribution by providing around 3.67% and 8.33% towards the Employee‚Äôs Provident Fund (EPF) and Employee Pension Scheme (EPS) respectively in the employee‚Äôs PF account. Example Calculation of PF Suppose an employee‚Äôs basic salary, along with dearness allowance, is ‚Çπ15,000. In this case, the employee‚Äôs Provident Fund contribution would amount to 12% of ‚Çπ15,000, which totals around ‚Çπ1,800. On the other hand, the employer‚Äôs contribution to the Employee Provident Fund would be 8.33% of ‚Çπ15,000, equivalent to approximately ‚Çπ1,250. To calculate the employee‚Äôs contributions to the Employee Provident Fund, we subtract the employee‚Äôs contributions to the Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme (EPS) from the employer‚Äôs contributions. In this scenario, the difference amounts to around ‚Çπ550. Consequently, the monthly total contribution to the Employee Provident Fund becomes ‚Çπ1,800 + ‚Çπ550, resulting in ‚Çπ2,350. Considering the rate of interest for the years 2022-2023 is 8.10%, the suitable monthly interest rate for calculating int",

    "question": "Fundamental Analysis vs Technical Analysis: Meaning and Key Differences",
    "answer": "Mutual Fund Diversification: Meaning, How it Works, and AdvantagesJune 27, 2023What Are the Benefits of PF?June 30, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle There are broadly two schools of thought when it comes to determining the price of a company. One predicts the stock price based on research, whereas the other relies on historical stock prices to forecast the future stock price. The former is fundamental analysis, whereas the latter is technical analysis. Both methods have distinct qualities and appeal to different types of market participants. This article explains in detail the meaning of fundamental and technical analysis and how they are different from each other. What is Fundamental Analysis? Fundamental analysis is a method used to determine the fair or intrinsic value of a company. It relies on the company‚Äôs fundamentals, such as revenue growth, profit growth, accounting ratios, management‚Äôs competency and business model to determine the value of its share. Apart from this, the analysis also takes into account the state of the economy and the strength of the industry to determine a company‚Äôs fair value. Once the intrinsic value of the company is determined, the analysts either mark it as overvalued or undervalued. An undervalued company‚Äôs share price is less than its intrinsic value, and an overvalued company‚Äôs share price is higher than its intrinsic value. The primary assumption behind this is that in the long term, the share price of a company will be similar to its intrinsic value. So, the price of an undervalued share will grow to reach its intrinsic value, and the price of an overvalued share will drop until it reaches its intrinsic value. Long-term investors use fundamental analysis to identify undervalued and overvalued shares so they can make buy or sell decisions on the stocks. An undervalued share makes an excellent buy, whereas an overvalued share indicates a ‚Äòsell‚Äô. Types of Fundamental Analysis There are two types of fundamental analysis that you can do to arrive at the intrinsic value; they are quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative analysis can be done using the numbers such as revenue, expenses, profit, assets, and liabilities. On the other hand, qualitative analysis is done by studying the business model of the company, its business cycles, customer base, management competency, intangible assets, and corporate governance. Quantitative analysis Financial statements are the biggest source for conducting quantitative analysis. Income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements are used to determine the financial health of a business. Following are some of the quantitative parameters to look at while doing fundamental analysis. Revenue growth: It is the primary indicator of how the business is performing. If the revenue is consistently improving, then it indicates the company is expanding its operations and attracting new customers. Profit growth: The ultimate goal for any business is to earn profits. A consistent increase in the profit and the margins indicates the company‚Äôs health is improving or stable. On the other hand, declining profits indicate falling efficiency of the business. Return ratios: Some of the important return ratios you must look at are return on equity, return on capital employed, and return on assets. These indicate how well a business is using its assets and capital to earn profits. A high and growing number indicates that the business is using its assets and capital efficiently. On the other hand, a falling number indicates otherwise. Working capital ratios: Current ratio and quick ratio are two working capital ratios that indicate the liquidity of the company. Ideally, a current ratio of 2:1 and a quick ratio of 1:1 indicate that the business is using its cash and cash equivalents correctly and has enough liquidity. However, anything less indicates that the business doesn‚Äôt have enough current assets to repay its current liabilities. Moreover, anything more than the ideal ratio indicates that the company is not using its working capital efficiently. Debt to equity ratio: A company can use debt to expand its business. However, a growing debt on the books can be a red flag. Ideally, a debt-to-equity ratio of 1x or below is considered ideal. Anything more indicates the company is overleveraged and has higher outside obligations, which affects the profitability of the company. These are just some of the many ratios used for quantitative analysis. You can use more para",

    "question": "What Is UAN and How Do You Generate It Online?",
    "answer": "What is Liquidity? Financial Liquidity DefinitionAugust 27, 2024How Do Loans Work?August 27, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle If you have joined a new organisation, you will be assigned a new provident fund (PF) account number. The amount accrued in your earlier PF account can either be withdrawn or transferred to the new PF account. For this process to go smoothly, you need a Universal Account Number (UAN). If you are wondering how to generate your UAN online, the easy step-by-step guide in this article will help you out. You can also discover the benefits of a UAN and the various ways you can link your Aadhaar to your EPF account. What Is a UAN? The UAN is a 12-digit exclusive identification number assigned by the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), an organisation that provides universal social security coverage for all workers of India by way of provident fund, pension and life insurance. This number is allocated to both the employer and employee so that they can make payment to the EPF account. After a UAN is created for an employee, it remains unchanged throughout their term with the organisation. However, after switching jobs, they will receive a new identification number (ID) from the EPFO, which they have to link to the existing UAN or EPFO account. For the company, the UAN remains constant for the entire tenure of the organisation till it stays in business. Features of UAN UAN helps maintain a single database of all PF accounts of an employee, allowing the EPFO to access personal details such as KYC and bank account information during the verification process. It is assigned to every employee with an Employee Provident Fund (EPF) account. When an employee changes jobs, the new PF account can be connected to all their earlier PF accounts upon submitting their UAN. Private organisations and their employees contribute an equal sum toward the PF account of the employee every month. UAN makes it easy to monitor the employer‚Äôs monthly contribution towards an employee‚Äôs PF account. Benefits of UAN for Employees Here are some advantages that UAN brings to the table: 1. Employers Cannot Withdraw or Withhold Settlement of PF Amount Your employer is not involved at all during the withdrawal of funds from your PF account when you change a job. UAN ensures that the money is automatically passed on to your new account once your KYC verification is complete. 2. Transferring Money Made Easier Before UAN, sending funds from the old PF account to the new one was done on a manual basis, which was a time-consuming process. With UAN, the UAN and KYC details can be given to the new employer for the transfer of PF funds, making the process much easier. 3. Keeps All Funds in One Place To avoid the lengthy process of transferring the EPF corpus fund, employees often preferred opening a separate PF account at their new workplace, thereby having several PF accounts. Since UAN makes these transfers easier, it centralises all your PF accounts across various companies and functions. 4. Added Benefits for the Employee Pension Scheme Due to the cumbersome process involved in PF transfers, many employees preferred to withdraw the PF amount but could not withdraw the employee pension. With UAN, your EPF and EPS accounts are both transferred automatically, giving you a higher lump sum amount after retirement. 5. Mobile Notifications for All Transactions With UAN, you can receive SMS notifications for every activity in your PF account, allowing you to easily keep tabs on your funds. How to Activate Your UAN: A Stepwise Guide Let‚Äôs discuss how you can activate your UAN online. Go to the EPFO Member portal. Select ‚ÄúActivate UAN‚Äù located on the right side of the screen under the ‚ÄúImportant Links‚Äù option. Enter your UAN, name, date of birth, email ID, and mobile number. After entering the details, select the ‚ÄúGet Authorisation PIN‚Äù button, which will be sent to your mobile number. Submit the OTP to activate the UAN. Now, your mobile number is registered with the EPF account. On UAN activation, you will receive a password on your registered mobile number to access your account. After this step, you will start receiving all SMS communications from EPFO. How to Know Your UAN Details You need not reach out to the EPF office if you want to know your UAN or have forgotten it. Simply follow these steps: Visit the unified member portal. Click on the ‚ÄúKnow your UAN‚Äù link on the homepage at the bottom right corner of the page. Enter your mobile num",

    "question": "How Many Mutual Funds Should I Invest In & How Much Is Too Much?",
    "answer": "Understanding Compounding in Mutual FundsDecember 8, 2022Mutual Fund Penalty: Meaning, Consequences and How to Avoid It?December 12, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Ever heard of the saying ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt put your eggs in one basket? It basically means diversifying your investments to reduce the risk of investing. But mutual funds already invest in multiple stocks, so isn‚Äôt one mutual fund enough to spread your risk? Well, the answer is no. One mutual fund has a little bit of everything but not enough of anything. Hence investing in one mutual fund is not enough. This might lead you to the question, ‚Äòhow many mutual funds should I have in my portfolio?‚Äô Read to find out the answer to this and how to build a mutual fund portfolio. Diversification of Mutual Funds Diversification is a risk management strategy wherein you spread your investments across multiple asset classes to reduce the portfolio‚Äôs overall risk. The idea behind diversification is that the risk of an individual security is reduced, and the portfolio will give higher returns in the long term. So basically, the underperformance of an asset is negated by the good performance of other assets, and the overall portfolio returns will be maintained in the short term. Diversification doesn‚Äôt eliminate the market risk, but it tends to reduce it by making your portfolio strong enough to face market volatility. Diversification is very important when investing in mutual funds. This is because the markets are not stable. Instability in the markets can lead to fluctuations in your portfolio as well. If one fund isn‚Äôt performing well, it doesn‚Äôt mean others do too. Diversification works well in mutual funds only if you spread your investments across asset classes and investment styles. This means investing in equity, debt, or gold funds and also ensuring you diversify within the asset class. Take, for example, equity funds. Invest in large, small, and mid-cap, or value and growth funds to reduce your risk of investing in equity. However, you have to be careful when diversifying. The major risk of diversification is over-diversification. Investing in too many mutual funds can actually harm your portfolio than do you good. Disadvantages of Diversification Over-diversification is simply diversifying too much. It happens when each additional asset added to the portfolio reduces overall return greater than risk reduction. In other words, when you over-diversify, you are not benefitting from that additional asset. Instead, you are increasing the portfolio‚Äôs risk. The following are the risks of over-diversification: Overall returns are affected: The overall portfolio returns are lower than you expected, mainly because the incremental asset is not adding value to the portfolio. In fact, it is harming the portfolio. Moreover, the purpose of diversification is lost, which is risk reduction. Higher expenses: By investing in multiple funds, you are incurring higher expenses. The overall cost increases, ultimately leading to lower returns. Difficult to monitor: The more the number of funds, the more difficult it is to monitor your portfolio. You have to keep track of all the funds and ensure they are performing well. The more the number of funds, the longer it takes to monitor your portfolio. This might ultimately discourage you from monitoring your portfolio, which might harm your portfolio. What is the 12-20-80 (baara, bees, aur assi) rule? Quantum Mutual Fund has introduced the 12-20-80 rule for asset allocation. Using this strategy, you can build a balanced portfolio to earn wealth in the long term and reduce downside volatility in the short term. 12 months ‚Äì Liquid fund: An emergency can knock on your door anytime. Hence it is important that you have a backup plan for such situations. Park at least 12 months of expenses in a liquid fund. This fund can be used to pay for bills, or expenses, during emergencies. 20% ‚Äì Invest 20% of your portfolio in gold. This will help you create a hedge against market volatility and inflation. Historically, gold always outperformed well when the markets underperformed, and vice versa. Hence investing 20% in gold will help balance the risk in your portfolio. Invest in gold ETFs or bonds, as they are very liquid and are safer than physical gold. 80% ‚Äì Invest 80% of your portfolio in equities to create wealth in the long term. Within equities, makes sure you invest across funds with different market capitalization and investment styles. Every investment sho",

    "question": "Understanding Remittance Meaning & How It Works",
    "answer": "How to Fill Form 12B? Steps To Fill The Form and TypesAugust 2, 2024What is Health Insurance?August 2, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle A remittance is a payment made by one party to another. Broadly, it includes all types of payments like invoices or bills. Generally, this term is used to describe the money sent by individuals who work abroad to their families in their domestic country. Read on to know more about it. What Is Remittance? It is a money transfer wherein one party sends funds to another party (either individual or a business). Generally, these payments are done via wire submissions or electronic transfers. Often, such transactions are international and can be quickly completed. Many people working abroad use this payment method to send money back home to their families. Remittance payments are also used to provide aid to developing countries and these comprise a part of the receiving country‚Äôs Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Often, such payments also represent one of the largest sources of earnings for people living in low-income and developing countries and can exceed international development assistance and direct investments. How Does Remittance Work? There are multiple ways in which such payments work. Some factors that influence the remitters‚Äô decisions include transaction costs, bank account access, the need for quick payments, and their preferences. Irrespective of which method is used, these payments follow a basic completion route. While initiating the transfer, the remitter must have the desired amount in their bank account. After issuing the payment, the money is transmitted by the receivers‚Äô banks for processing. When the receivers‚Äô banks have the amount, the applicable banking fee and currency exchange rate are applied. The funds are then available in the receivers‚Äô accounts in their local currency after the applicable charges are deducted from the remitted amount. Is Remittance Taxable in India? The rules governing the taxation of such transfers vary from one country to another. In India, the taxation is based on the type of payment, which is as below: Inward Remittance Money received in an Indian bank account from relatives based abroad is known as inward remittance, which is governed by the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). The amount is not taxable only if it is for meeting living expenses, medical treatment, education, donations, travel expenses, and gifts. However, if the receivers invest this money, any income generated from such investment is taxable. As per the RBI guidelines for inward remittance (Reserve Bank of India) and FEMA, the following members can receive tax-free money: Senders‚Äô lineal descendants and ascendants Spouses‚Äô lineal descendants and ascendants Spouse of the aforementioned Senders‚Äô spouse Siblings Spouses‚Äô siblings Senders‚Äô parents‚Äô siblings Outward remittance Any amount transferred outside the country is known as a foreign outward remittance Parents sending money to their children studying abroad is one such example. Under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS), all Indian residents can remit up to $250,000 during the financial year to any authorized capital or current account. As per the new sub-section 206C (1G) of the Finance Act 2020, all remittances under LRS are subject to a 5% Tax Collected at Source (TCS). The TCS is levied at 0.5% if the amount is paid as an installment for a higher education loan. What Is Remittance Advice? Suppliers may get a remittance advice letter from customers. This document is proof that the invoice payment is complete. This letter is generally given by the customers at the time of making the payment. Some vendors may include this section within their invoices, which are then signed by the customers and duly returned. Sending this letter is not mandatory while transferring money. Nonetheless, it helps suppliers to match the amount received with the invoice and maintain their records. With the increasing use of electronic transfers, the practice of sending such advice is reducing; however, it continues to be adopted when payments are made via checks. How to Send Remittance Advice? While sending the advice letter to the suppliers, customers should include the following details: Invoice number Payment date and expected date of receiving the money Payment amount and method Suppliers‚Äô complete name and address Customers‚Äô name and address There are no regulatory guidelines on how to send this advice letter.

    "question": "What is the Time Value of Money (TMV) and Why is it Important?",
    "answer": "Debt Explained: Types, Benefits, and How It Works ExplainedJuly 27, 2022What is ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan)? ‚Äì How It WorksJuly 27, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Time Value of Money (TVM) is a financial concept wherein the value of money is much higher now, at present than the same sum of money will be in the future. This is because money at present can only grow if it is invested and can help you earn returns. However, the same amount of money can lose value to inflation over time. Thus, while the cash at present enables you to accumulate higher value, the same sum would have lesser buying power in the future. Moreover, the money not invested now loses value over time; even when it might look promising. Let us see an example to understand this better. Imagine you have Rs. 5000 today. This money can get you an interest of 5% when invested or help you buy 100 bottles of mineral water. However, after two years, each bottle of water may cost up to Rs. 20 while the value of the money remains the same. In such a scenario,its utility and purchasing power both have dropped. Instead of 100 bottles, your purchasing power is down to half. Time Value of Money (TVM) is an underlying concept for all financial decisions, from taking a loan to salary and purchase decisions. It is one concept that comes in handy in all situations to evaluate decision-making and taking a calculated risk. Time Value of Money (TVM) Calculation The Time Value of Money (TVM) is also referred to as Net Present Value (NPV) of money or Present Discounted Value. The following formula can be used to calculate: Future Value of Money (FV) FV = PV x [1+ (i/n)] (nxt) Present Value of Money (PV) PV = FV / [1+ (i/n)] (nxt) Here, FV is Future Value PV is Present Value i stands for the interest rate or return that can be earned on money t stands for the number of years under consideration n stands for the number of compounding periods of interest per year Not just interest rates and time period, but the Time Value of Money (TVM) also depends upon how many times the compounding calculations are computed per year. Each compounding period increase- daily, quarterly, monthly directly impacts the Future Value of Money. Let us take an example to understand it better. Assume you have Rs. 20,000 and there is an interest rate of 10% on it, which is calculated quarterly, monthly and daily for a year. In such a case, the Future Value (FV) of money would be different. Time Value of Money (TVM) Formula Compounding Period Formula Future Value (FV) Quarterly FV = Rs. 20,000 x [1+10%/4] (4*1) Rs. 21,038 Monthly FV = Rs. 20,000 x [1+10%/12] (12*1) Rs. 21,047 Daily FV = Rs. 20,000 x [1+10%/365] (365*1) Rs. 21,052 Example of Time Value of Money (TVM) Let us take our earlier example to calculate the Future Value (FV) of money. We assume that the interest is compounded annually for a two-year period. FV = Rs. 5000 x [1+(5%/1)] (1√ó2) FV = Rs. 5,512.50 Let us take another example to better understand how to calculate Present Value (PV). You are offered Rs. 1000 today as against Rs. 1,100 after one year. Now, if you get 5% interest on it, we need to calculate how much money is required now to get the Future Value (FV) of the money which is Rs. 1,100. How do we calculate this? PV = Rs. 1,100/ [1+(5%/1] (1√ó1) PV = Rs. 1,047 3 Basic Parameters of Time Value of Money (TVM) The Time Value of Money (TVM) is directly related to the following parameters, and you need to calculate the returns of money invested by keeping the following factors in mind. Inflation ‚Äì It reduces the purchasing power of money and raises the cost of goods and services. Thus, your purchasing capacity with the same amount of money reduces. Therefore, if the inflation rate is higher than the investment return rate, one will lose out on money value even with positive returns due to purchasing power fluctuations. Opportunity Cost ‚Äì It is the loss related to an investment and the profit linked to it due to the commitment of money in another investment for a stipulated time period. There could be times when a particular financial decision prevents you from investing and taking advantage of Time Value of Money (TVM). Risk ‚Äì It is the risk that investors take while investing their money in investment assets. Let us take an example to understand this further. Suppose you have invested Rs. 1,000 at an annual interest rate of 8.5% for 5 years. The inflation rate was 2.5% at the start of the investment period. In the first yea",

In 2009, it was made available to all citizens. You may invest in this pension scheme until retirement. When you turn 60 years old, you are allowed to withdraw 60% of the accumulated corpus, which is tax-free. The balance amount is used to buy annuity plans that offer regular income after retirement. How does the National Pension Scheme work? The minimum annual contribution to NPS is INR 6,000, which can be invested as a lump sum or in monthly installments of INR 500 each. Your money is put in market-related instruments like equity and debt as per your choice and the returns depend on the performance of these investments. Features and benefits of NPS Liquidity At the time of opening the NPS account, you receive a Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN). Tier-I account is the primary account that is used to make your contribution and comes with withdrawal restrictions. Tier-II accounts are voluntary and have no withdrawal restrictions. Therefore, you can enjoy liquidity when you open a Tier-II account. Flexibility You may choose the automatic investment option wherein your contribution is managed by the fund manager based on your age and profile. Alternatively, you may opt for the active choice that allows you to choose the asset classes to invest your money in. The maximum equity investment is limited to 50% and the balance is put in corporate debt and government securities. You can also switch between automatic and active choices, giving you additional flexibility. Furthermore, you can switch fund managers; however, these switches are subject to certain regulations. Partial withdrawals This is a noteworthy NPS benefit; it allows you to withdraw some portion of the accumulated corpus to meet emergency fund requirements. You may withdraw up to 25% of the corpus from the Tier-I account provided you have contributed for at least ten years. Moreover, there should be a minimum gap of five years between two partial withdrawals. National Pension Scheme tax benefits The NPS tax benefits are as follows: Up to INR 1.50 lakhs contributed to Tier-I account under section 80 CCD (1). Additional benefit of INR 50,000 under section 80 CCD (1B). Employer contribution of up to 14% for government personnel and up to 10% for others under section 80CCD (2). Other tax advantages are: Tax exemption on up to 25% of withdrawals from the Tier-I account. Lump-sum withdrawal of up to 40% of the accumulated corpus once you are 60 years old is exempted from tax. Annuity purchase with the remaining 60% NPS corpus is tax-exempt; however, annual income earned on these is taxable. NPS offers significant tax benefits to encourage retirement savings. The tax benefits are as follows: Tax Section Benefit Section 80CCD(1) Deduction up to 10% of salary (basic + DA) for salaried individuals or 20% of gross income for self-employed, subject to a limit of ‚Çπ1.5 lakh (part of Section 80C).

    "question": "How To Create Wealth from Salary?",
    "answer": "Personal Finance: Guide for Beginners and Experienced AdultsSeptember 11, 2024Difference between IPO and FPOSeptember 12, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Who does not want to be wealthy? Some people may live thriftily to save while others may invest in high-risk instruments to build wealth. But before discussing how to become wealthy, let us begin by understanding the meaning of wealth. What is wealth? The meaning differs for every person. For some, it may mean investing in profitable instruments while others may consider wealth as property ownership. Wealth is the accumulation of valuable resources measurable in money or real goods. It is determined by subtracting your debt from the market value of all your tangible and intangible assets. Different types of income Building wealth without a regular source of income is difficult. Without an income, you may not be able to save and invest. Income can be classified as earned and passive earnings. Earned income Sustainable wealth can be built through value creation over the long term. It is recommended you find a good job and retain it to earn regular income. If you are a business owner, focus on long-term value creation. Passive income Unlike a job or business, passive income is generated without your constant presence. It can be earned either via investing or from other sources. There are several ways on how to make money online, but it is advisable to be cautious about websites that promote proposals on getting rich quickly. Some ways to earn are through digitally selling products, affiliate marketing, blogging, and drop shipping. Three things involved in accumulating wealth over time The three things needed for wealth creation are as follows: Making money Before saving or investing, you must have a regular and stable source of income where you have some amount left after paying for your debts and necessities. Some ways to make money are as follows: Side hustles Relying only on one source of income is not advisable. Use a talent or hobby to increase your earnings. There are several ways on how to make money by running side hustles. Some of these include freelance editing and writing, app or web development, working as a virtual assistant, online coaching, consulting, or tutoring. You can also run side hustles by becoming a part-time gym instructor, college professor, or freelance bookkeeper. Invest in your education Most people focus on reducing their expenses to increase savings. However, you can also increase your income to have higher savings. Investing in your education to hone your skills can give you several additional opportunities to increase your income. You may pursue a Masters‚Äô degree or take up a specialized course to be eligible for promotion and appraisal. Venture into a business Some of the wealthiest people are business owners and not employees. Entrepreneurship gives you the chance to earn higher income and returns for wealth accumulation. The business does not have to be big, and you can create wealth even with a small business idea. Saving money After earning enough to take care of your basic requirements, develop a proactive savings plan. Cut down your expenses Once you are committed to reducing your expenses, you will be surprised to know about different ways on how to save money. Buying your groceries in bulk and cooking your meals at home can significantly reduce your food expenses. And if you still want to order online, look for deals and offers to reduce your costs. Make a budget to determine your necessities and trim the excess to increase your savings. Stop buying unnecessary things Impulsive shopping can significantly reduce your saving capability. Stop spending on unnecessary things like designer clothes and accessories. Also, avoid taking frequent holidays. Learn to differentiate between your needs and wants. Being frugal may seem unsatisfying but the wealth you accumulate over the years is worth the effort. Save on vehicles Car loans make it easy to buy one; however, do your research and do not go beyond your budget. And even if you have your vehicle, carpooling, renting a car, and using public transport for daily commute can significantly reduce your travel costs while also saving on maintenance expenses. Save on shelter Having your own house can indicate being successful. However, if you have a job that requires moving frequently, consider renting to avoid the hassle of buying and selling a home in every new location. Also, if the rent is",

    "question": "What Is Automated Teller Machine (ATM) And How Does It Work?",
    "answer": "What is A Subsidy? Types of Subsidies, Examples, and Their Meaning ExplainedJuly 27, 2022Debt Explained: Types, Benefits, and How It Works ExplainedJuly 27, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle ATMs have been in existence for quite some time. Like most of us, you might be unaware that these machines are not new. In fact, their existence goes back to the early 1960s. The creation of ATMs was in response to the rising demand for a banking service that could be provided by a machine. With the introduction of ATMs, banking services became widespread, including in remote villages. What exactly are ATM Machines? ATM stands for Automated Teller Machine, and it can be defined as a self-service banking facility. You can make a withdrawal, check your account balance, as well as transfer funds from these machines. ATM services are provided by several banks in various locations of the nation. You may withdraw cash from these ATMs regardless of whether you have an account with the same banking institution. With the advancement of technology, ATMs have become sophisticated. The ATM is not just for withdrawing cash anymore; it has evolved into a human interface (HMI) for numerous financial services such as cash deposits, bill transactions, as well as bank transfers. Based on your banking institution, ATM services are either complimentary or incur a small fee. Typically, institutions do not charge fees for the initial 3-5 transactions by an ATM card every month. If you exceed your complimentary ATM transaction limit, you may be required to pay a small fee. Furthermore, some banks impose fees if you withdraw cash from an Automated Teller Machine of an institution with which you do not have an account. How does an ATM function? The ATM has been a familiar part of the banking experience for years, but what many people don‚Äôt know is how it all works. How can you type in a random series of digits and get money from an ATM? What is the network that approves of the transactions? Why do they approve your transaction when someone else‚Äôs is denied? An Automatic Teller Machine or ATM is a type of banking outlet that receives fund deposits and disburses cash withdrawals. ATM services are started by either putting cash (in the case of Cash Deposit) or a debit/credit card into the machine. The machine is simply an add-on of the bank‚Äôs servers; it contacts the bank‚Äôs servers to check an account balance and the legitimacy, disburses or collects the money, and then sends a ‚Äòsuccessful transaction‚Äô notification. To sum it all up, it is safe to say that an ATM terminal is essentially a remote banking device with a secure cash vault connected to it. What are the features of Modern ATMs? With the advent of the internet age, ATM machines have seen many changes over time. From being operated manually, they are now automated and are even capable of generating customised and personalised messages for their users. Technology has evolved to deliver a better user experience and faster transactions. Modern ATMs include the following features: Multipurpose in Nature: ATM machines have changed the face of banking, and we‚Äôve evolved from a time when these kiosks simply provided access to cash. Modern ATM machines now provide a wide range of services and can accomplish most of your banking tasks. They let you deposit money, transfer funds, settle bills, and generate PIN and micro statements. These are only a handful of the services offered by banks, which also offer a wide range of sophisticated ATM services. It‚Äôs hard to imagine a world without ATM machines‚Äîparticularly given how much human time they reduce. For example, you might choose to complete your business transactions by withdrawing funds from an ATM when your local bank is closed or if you are visiting another country and need cash. Simple and Quick Services: Every second of our lives, at least one ATM transaction is being carried out somewhere in the world. From simple withdrawals to elaborate transactions, ATMs make life easy. ATMs are simpler to operate for everybody, including first-time customers as well as individuals with disabilities. Biometric identity scanners, for example, make it easy for practically everyone to use. Multiple Language Support: India is a land of innumerable cultures and languages. The usage of a single language in ATM machines creates a stumbling hurdle for many consumers. The usage of multilingual or multiple languages in ATMs functions as a remedy to this issue.

    "question": "Amortization: What is it? Calculator, Formulae and More",
    "answer": "How to Improve Your CIBIL or Credit Score in Simple StepsSeptember 5, 2024Credit Card SkimmingSeptember 9, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle The original value of all types of business assets can be expensed every year during their entire lifetime. These expenses are used to reduce the taxable income, which in turn decreases the tax liability for the companies. The two primary methods of calculating the value of the different business assets are depreciation and amortization. A third mechanism for expensing such assets is depletion, which is an accrual method generally used by businesses extracting natural resources. With loans, amortizing the borrowed amount focuses on spreading the loan repayments over its tenure. What is amortization? Amortization is primarily the process of incrementally charging the cost of business assets over their expected life. As a result, these assets are shifted from the balance sheet to the profit and loss (P&L) account. Amortizing is the gradual writing down of the cost of intangible assets over their useful life. Some examples of intangible assets include franchise agreements, organizational costs, expenses incurred for issuing bonds to raise capital, copyrights, trademarks, patents, and licenses. It is also applicable to other items like deferred charges and discounts on notes receivables. The journal entry to record amortizing of intangible assets is debit to the expense account and credit to the accumulated amortized value. If an intangible asset is considered to have an endless life, it is subject to a periodic impairment test, which results in the reduction of the asset‚Äôs book value. What is loan amortization? The concept of amortizing is also applicable in terms of lending. The loan amortization schedule shows the starting value of the borrowed amount, minus the principal repayment and interest payable in each period, and the ending balance amount. The schedule shows that during the initial loan tenure, a larger amount of the installment is paid towards interest due. The proportions of interest payments reduce as the borrowers continue repaying the principal amount. How does amortization work? Unlike depreciation, amortizing intangible assets is generally done using the straight-line method (SLM). This means the same amount is amortized in each period during the entire useful life of the assets. Moreover, assets that are amortized generally do not have any salvage or resale value. In lending, the amortization table shows the series of loan repayments comprising principal and interest in each instalment over the entire tenure. How to calculate amortization Calculating the amortized value is possible with spreadsheet packages like Microsoft Excel, advanced financial calculators, or online calculators. The schedule starts by showing the opening loan balance. To determine the monthly instalment amount, the interest is calculated by multiplying the loan balance by the rate of interest and dividing it by 12. The principal due in a particular month is the difference between the equated monthly instalment (EMI) and the interest for that period. In the next month, the outstanding loan amount is the previous month‚Äôs opening balance minus the last principal payment. The interest is then calculated on this amount. This entire process continues until all the principal payments are made and the outstanding loan balance becomes zero. Formula for amortization Having understood what loan amortization is and how it is calculated, the formula for estimating the monthly principal amount due on an amortized loan is as follows: Principal amount = TMP ‚Äì [(OLB x Interest Rate/12)] Where TMP is the total monthly payment OLB is the outstanding loan balance The monthly instalment is pre-determined when borrowers avail of the loan. If borrowers want to calculate the approximate monthly payment to compare different loans offered by lenders, they may use the following formula: Total payment = Loan amount x [I x (1+I/n) / (1+I)/n) ‚Äì 1] Where I is the monthly rate of interest N is the number of payments To derive the monthly rate of interest, individuals must divide the interest rate by 12. Additionally, they need to multiply the number of years in the loan tenure by 12.

    "question": "Section 80C of Income Tax Act ‚Äì Limits, Deductions, and Additional Deductions",
    "answer": "Lump Sum Investment Plan 2023: Meaning and OverviewSeptember 1, 2022Types of Equity Funds in India and its Benefits & ImportanceSeptember 1, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle The Income Tax Act, 1961 offers several benefits and deductions when you invest in certain financial products. Section 80C is a clause in the Act that lists the investments and expenses that are eligible for income tax deductions. For effective financial planning, you need to be completely aware of tax planning. Being aware of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act is imperative for the same. This article will go over the details of Section 80C Income Tax. What is Section 80C of the Income Tax Act? Section 80C allows you to deduct up to 1.5 lakh from your taxable income for certain investments. In instance, Section 80CCC allows a person to deduct up to 1.5 lakh per year for contributions paid to selected pension schemes. However, there are certain sub-section of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 called 80CCC, 80CCD(1), 80CCD(1B) and 80CCD(2). <Details of these sections are mentioned below>. Thus, the overall tax deduction available under section 80C is Rs 1.5 lakhs (under sections 80C, 80CCC, 80CCD(1) and 80CCD(2)) and an additional amount of Rs 0.5 lakhs under section 80CCD(1B). How does Section 80C work? If you are new to the list of tax benefits and Section 80 C, let us take a step-by-step look into how it works. Section 80 C is a set of deductions that you can avail of against your overall taxable income for the previous year. It enables individuals to minimize their taxable income by making tax-advantaged investments or incurring qualified expenses. It enables a maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh from the taxpayer‚Äôs total income per year. Assume you got total taxable earnings of Rs 20,00,000 in the previous year, 2023-24. The Assessment Financial Year will be 2024-25 when you calculate and pay the tax amount on this earning. The overall tax deduction available under section 80C is Rs 1.5 lakhs (under section 80C, 80CCC, 80CCD(1) and 80CCD(2)) and an additional amount of Rs 0.5 lakhs under section 80CCD(1B), thereby amounting to a total of Rs 2 lakhs. Suppose you have invested Rs. 2 lakhs of these earnings in any or all of the activities described in Sec 80C. In that case, you reduce your overall tax liability for the previous year to Rs 1.8 lakhs. Eligibility criteria for section 80C deductions The benefits are available to individuals and HUFs. Additionally, Indians, as well as Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), are eligible for tax deductions. You must file your income tax return (ITR) by July 31 every year to enjoy the Section 80C benefits. How can I get tax breaks from Section 80C of the Income Tax Act? Tax deductions make a huge difference when it comes to tax filing. Suppose you want to keep as much money as possible for yourself. In that case, you will want to know about every single itemized deduction available. The best way to do that is to talk to your accountant if you have one or to use an online tax calculator during tax season. Section 80C activities are grouped into two categories: Investments: You place your funds in assets for some time and then withdraw them. Provident Fund (VPF ‚Äì Voluntary Provident Fund or EPF ‚Äì Employee Provident Fund) National Saving Certificate 5-year Post Office Time Deposit NHB Deposit Scheme Public Provident Fund Tax-saving 5-year Fixed Deposit from Bank Senior Citizen Saving Scheme Life Insurance Premium Equity Linked Saving Scheme Unit Linked Insurance Plans Atal Pension Yojana (New Pension Scheme) Insurance Company Pension Plans Spending: You spend your cash on the activities indicated in section 80C. Principal Amount Repayment of Home Loan Stamp Duty & Home Registration Cost 2-children Tuition Fees To take full advantage of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, you need to be aware of the elements you can add to the list. At least one of these elements must apply to every taxpayer. If anyone adds more, they could likely reduce their tax liability considerably. This deduction is just an addition to your annual expenses. However, you should not miss it since the savings on that front can go a long way in helping you meet other financial goals. How much tax break can I get from Section 80C of the Income Tax Act?

    "answer": "Virtual Debit Cards: Empowering Consumers in the Digital AgeJanuary 26, 2024How to Block and Unblock Debit Cards?January 27, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle There was a time when only a handful of Indians had a bank account. Now, even a small vegetable vendor is accepting digital payments. This is only possible through the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). With UPI, individuals can send and receive money through their mobile. Moreover, just one mobile application can help handle the transactions of multiple bank accounts. To use UPI and set a UPI PIN, it was mandatory to have a debit card. However, the government has introduced an alternative where you can set your UPI PIN without using a debit card. Read on to find out how to set a UPI PIN without a debit card. How to Use UPI Without a Debit Card? The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is the umbrella organisation that manages the transaction routing, processing, and settlement services of UPI members. When UPI was first set up, NPCI mandated the use of debit cards to register for UPI and set a UPI PIN. To encourage cashless transactions in India, it introduced an alternative to setting up a UPI PIN without using a debit card. Users who do not have debit cards can also register for UPI now. They can use their Aadhar card to set up their UPI PIN. The Aadhar-based verification was introduced in September 2021. To use the Aadhar-based verification, you must link your mobile number with your Aadhar Card and bank account. Setting up a UPI PIN with an Aadhar Card is a one-time procedure. In the next section, let‚Äôs understand the step-by-step process of setting up a UPI PIN without a debit card. How to Set UPI PIN Without Debit Card? You can set up a UPI PIN without a debit card by using your Aadhaar card: Download a UPI application app such as BHIM UPI, Google Pay, PhonePe, or Paytm. Go to your profile and select ‚ÄòSet up payment method‚Äô or ‚ÄòAdd bank account‚Äô. Select your bank and verify your phone number with the bank. Once the phone number is verified, you will have to set up the UPI PIN. Select the Aadhar-based verification option and accept the terms and conditions. Validate your Aadhar Card details by entering the first six digits of your Aadhar Card. After successfully validating your Aadhar details, set up your four or six-digit UPI PIN. You will now need to verify with Aadhar OTP. After verification, re-enter your UPI PIN for confirmation. Now, your UPI app is ready to be used for transactions. You can use the same process to register multiple bank accounts. Make sure you select the right bank. The above procedure can vary slightly for different apps, but the gist remains the same. Once you set up your UPI PIN, shopping and transacting become easy, removing the need to carry cash. Tips to Ensure Safety While Setting UPI Pin The following tips will help you set up your UPI Pin safely and securely. Choose a strong PIN: Always ensure that the UPI PIN you set up is complex and unique. It should be such that it is difficult for others to guess. Use secure devices: When setting up your UPI PIN, make sure you use your own phone or other secured device. Keep your PIN confidential: Never write down your UPI PIN anywhere, nor share it with anyone. Just memorise it to avoid any fraud. Monitor account activity: If you find unauthorised transactions in your UPI payment history, report them immediately to the concerned authority. Beware of UPI frauds: Technology comes with security issues. Although UPI is an advanced interface, it is not safe from cyber fraud. Do not click on any link asking you to pay a certain amount. Benefits of Setting Up UPI PIN with an Aadhar Card The following are the benefits of setting up UPI with an Aadhar Card. If you do not have a debit card, or you lost it, or it is inactive, then you can still set up your UPI PIN through Aadhar. Some users aren‚Äôt comfortable linking their debit cards to UPI. By linking Aadhar cards to UPI, they feel safe and secure. With cashless transactions, users are not opting for debit cards and are embracing digital-only banking. UPI is being used heavily in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where ATMs have still not been reached. In such cases, Aadhar-based verification comes in handy. If you feel your UPI PIN is compromised, then you can reset it through Aadhar-based verification. How to Reset UPI Pin Using Aadhar Card? You can set your UPI PIN using an Aadhar Card and reset it if you feel your UPI PIN is compromised. The f",

It not only brings a sense of financial independence but also boosts your self-esteem and confidence.

This is the time to start building a solid financial foundation that will help you achieve your long-term goals. Now if you are reading this article for the sake of writing an essay that your professor asked for, here‚Äôs a quick intro for you below. Let‚Äôs dive into real adulting guide after the intro. ‚ÄúI got my first salary and it felt like I unlocked a new level in life‚Äî part excitement, part ‚Äúadulting‚Äù reality check. After all those years of studying and dreaming about financial freedom, seeing that first ‚ÄòXXX amount credited to your account‚Äô SMS was surreal. Of course, the urge to blow it all on things I‚Äôve always wanted was strong (hey, online shopping wish list!), but I knew this was also my chance to start building good money habits. So, what should I really do with my first salary? Let‚Äôs dive into the fun‚Äîand responsibility‚Äîof figuring that out.‚Äù Whether it‚Äôs buying a house, a car, or pursuing further education, taking those first steps towards financial stability will ensure that you‚Äôre well-prepared for the road ahead. By taking a proactive approach to managing your finances early on, you can set yourself up for success and achieve your goals faster. So, here are some key things to do when you receive your first paycheck to help you take control of your finances and build a solid financial future. What To Do With First Salary? Your first monthly income could range from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 2 lakhs or more, depending on your specialisation. However, how you manage your money has little to do with how much you make. The methods described here can help you save for your future no matter where you are on the pay scale. 1. Make a Budget Creating and following a budget is essential for managing your earnings effectively. A budget helps you keep track of every rupee you earn and spend and allows you to adopt a savings plan that works for you. One popular budgeting rule for beginners is the 50-30-20 rule. This simple rule divides your monthly income into three categories: 50% for your needs, 30% for your wants, and 20% for your savings. For example, if you earn Rs. 50,000 per month, you can allocate Rs. 25,000 for your needs, like rent, EMI, and provisions, Rs. 15,000 for your wants, like entertainment and eating out, and Rs. 10,000 for your savings. By following this rule, you can balance your spending and savings, and work towards achieving your long-term financial goals. 2. Build an Emergency Fund ‚ÄúAlmost 55% of all expenditure on health in India is financed out-of-pocket‚Äù (Source: How much do Indian households spend on healthcare every month?. So, safety First. Building an emergency fund is an essential component of financial planning, particularly if you want to avoid debt. It enables you to prepare for unforeseen situations, such as a sudden home or vehicle repair, or a medical emergency. For example, imagine you‚Äôve been working for two years when a family member has a medical emergency, resulting in a significant bill that you need to pay. Without an emergency fund, you may need to dip into your savings or borrow funds, which can cause financial stress and increase your debt. But if you have an emergency fund, you can cover the expense without affecting your savings or accumulating more debt. Experts typically recommend having an emergency fund that‚Äôs at least 10 times your monthly income, although you may need to build a more substantial fund depending on your circumstances. By building an emergency fund, you can prepare for the unexpected and safeguard your financial stability, ensuring that you‚Äôre always ready for whatever life throws your way. 3. Pay Any Kind Off Debt It‚Äôs no secret that having your own income can be exciting and tempting, but it‚Äôs important to resist the urge to rack up debt. Using credit cards to the maximum limit or taking out a personal loan may seem like a quick solution, but it can quickly derail your savings plan. To effectively manage your first salary,",

    "question": "What is PF in Salary ‚Äì Meaning, Full Form & Calculations in Employee Provident Fund",
    "answer": "Best Money Transfer Apps in India (With Play Store Ratings) ‚Äì Top 25 AppsApril 7, 2025Salary Certificate Format in Word and PDF: Free Downloadable TemplateApril 8, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle In salary terms, ‚ÄúPF‚Äù means Provident Fund‚Äîa retirement savings where both employee and employer contribute. In the realm of employment and remuneration, it is essential to understand the various components that make up an employee‚Äôs salary. This article aims to delve into the concept of PF in salary, explaining its types and PF eligibility. By gaining clarity on this topic, individuals can better comprehend their financial entitlements and plan for a secure future. What is PF in Salary? The Provident Fund (PF) is an important savings scheme for employees, aimed at providing financial security in the long run. By contributing to the PF, employees can build a retirement fund that helps cover living expenses after they stop working. This can include costs for healthcare or even leisure activities during retirement. Besides being a retirement fund, the PF can act as an emergency reserve. Under certain conditions, you can withdraw some or all of the money if you need it. Additionally, the money you put into the PF is tax-free up to ‚Çπ1.5 Lakhs under Section 80(C) of the Indian Income Tax Act, but this applies only if you choose the Old Tax Regime. As per the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Act, your contribution is limited to 12% of your salary and dearness allowance. Your employer matches this amount, but it‚Äôs worth noting that 8.33% of their contribution goes into the Employee Pension Scheme, while the remaining 3.67% is directed to your PF account. The PF is included in your Cost to Company (CTC), which is the total amount your employer spends on you, ensuring you have benefits for retirement. What are the Types of Provident Funds? Depending on your employment, different types of provident funds are available in India. They include: Statutory Provident Fund This provident fund type is primarily established for employees working for the government, railways, universities and educational institutions, and other specified entities. The eligible employees for this type of provident fund account earn interest rates, decided as per the government, on their savings. Recognised Provident Fund This provident fund type is for private sector employees from organisations with more than 20 employees. Such companies can either have their own PF account or join a government PF scheme. If the company chooses to have its own PF trust, they need approval from the CIT (Commissioner of Income Tax.) Unrecognised Provident Fund This type of PF is when the CIT does not approve the above case of recognised provident fund. Public Provident Fund PPF Public Provident Fund, is a type of PF open to the public. Anyone can invest in it. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the nature of your employment is. So, whether you are self-employed or salaried, you can invest in this PF scheme as long as you have the funds to invest. The tenure for PPF is about 15 years, and you can invest ‚Çπ500 to ‚Çπ1.5 Lakh yearly. How Does PF (Provident Fund) Work? Provident Fund (PF) is a retirement fund that helps salaried employees save money. Here‚Äôs how it works: Companies with more than 20 employees are required to provide Provident Fund (PF) benefits to their staff. Mandatory Contribution: If you earn less than ‚Çπ15,000 per month, it‚Äôs mandatory to be part of the EPF (Employees‚Äô Provident Fund) scheme. Voluntary Contribution: Those earning over ‚Çπ15,000 per month can still choose to participate in the PF scheme voluntarily. Contribution Rate: The minimum contribution rate is set at 12%, though you can contribute more voluntarily. However, your employer is not obligated to match any additional contributions beyond 12%. Benefits: Being a part of the EPF scheme gives you access to pension and insurance benefits under the Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme (EPS) and the Employees‚Äô Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI). Tax Benefits: Since EPF is categorised under the EEE (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) tax system, the maturity amount will be tax-free as long as you‚Äôve served for at least five continuous years. Withdrawal: You can withdraw your PF balance after retirement or under certain conditions, such as buying a house or medical emergencies. Transfer: In the unfortunate event of your death, your nominee has the right to withdraw your PF balance. Disadvantages: There are some disadvantages to be aware of. For example",

    "question": "8 Best Retirement Investment Plans & Options",
    "answer": "How to Validate Credit CardAugust 28, 2024Is UPI safe? Ways to Protect & Secure Your UPI TransactionsAugust 29, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Several people in India do not have any financial plans for their post-retirement years. However, during these critical times when healthcare expenses are constantly on the rise and there is little dependence on children for financial assistance, ensuring your retirement corpus provides maximum benefits is important. Why is Retirement Planning Important? Your regular income discontinues when you retire and without enough investments and savings, sustaining your current lifestyle after retirement may be difficult. If you invest your money in a bank savings account, the rate of interest is lower than the inflation rate, which means it will be inadequate to meet your future requirements. Without retirement planning, you may have to depend on others for financial assistance and may face severe constraints in case of emergencies. How to Choose Retirement Investment Plan? You may choose from different investment options; however, opting for the right financial instruments is important. The chosen retirement investment options should not only grow your savings but also give you a regular income during your golden years. While selecting the investment plans, consider the following factors. Write down your retirement goals Determine your regular expenses and take into account an inflationary increase in the costs Consider all your income sources after you retire, such as pension funds, insurance policies, etc. Estimate the number of years you will survive after retirement Think about your risk appetite These points will enable you to estimate the retirement corpus you will need, which can help you identify the right retirement investment plans. 8 Best Retirement Investment Options Mutual Fund Investments MFs are an excellent option to build a retirement corpus. They can offer between 12% and 15% annual returns over a period. However, interest rates are not fixed. You may choose between different types of schemes, such as equity, debt, and balanced funds. Initially, you may invest in equity funds and as retirement draws closer, you may switch to debt funds. You may invest a small amount at regular intervals via systematic investment plans (SIPs) in some of the best mutual funds for retirement and build a large corpus over the long term. Public Provident Fund (PPF) PPF is a government-backed scheme, and your investments are eligible for tax benefits under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. An amount of up to INR 1.50 lakhs per year is eligible for a tax deduction. It has a lock-in period of 15 years, and the interest rate is pre-determined by the government. Fixed Deposits (FDs) FDs have been a popular investment choice for decades. These deposits offer assured returns over the investment tenure. Traditionally, only banks offered FDs; however, now several non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) also offer corporate FDs. Generally, the interest offered by NBFCs on FDs is higher when compared to bank deposits. You may opt for cumulative deposits that help build a huge corpus because the interest is reinvested with the principal. Most deposit issuers offer a higher rate of interest to senior citizens. Alternatively, if you want to earn a regular income, you may choose non-cumulative FDs. Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) This scheme is aimed at senior citizens who want income after they retire. You may invest up to INR 15 lakhs in Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) and earn a pre-determined interest rate on the amount. The scheme matures in five years but has a provision to extend the investment tenure by three years from the date of maturity. The interest is paid at quarterly intervals. Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS) You can invest from INR 1500 up to INR 4.50 lakhs in POMIS. The scheme has five-year tenure but does not offer any tax benefits. POMIS is not recommended if you are in the higher income tax bracket because the returns are taxable. Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY) It is a guaranteed pension scheme that offers a monthly payout for ten years. PMVVY has been extended up to 31st March 2023, and the entry age is above 60 years. You may invest at least INR 1.50 lakhs to get a monthly pension of INR 1000. There are no tax benefits for investments in this scheme. You may avail of a loan for up to 75% of the deposited amount after three years. Invest in ",

    "question": "All About Gratuity ‚Äì Rules, Eligibility & Calculation",
    "answer": "What is Variable Pay ‚Äì All You Need to KnowJuly 23, 2024Difference Between RuPay, Visa and MastercardJuly 28, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle What is Gratuity? Gratuity is paid by the employers to the employees as gratitude for the services rendered during their employment. It is a part of the employees‚Äô salaries and is a component of their gross remuneration. The amount is paid to the employees when their employment ends and is an acknowledgment given to them for providing their services to the organization. Read on to know everything about it. What is Gratuity in Salary? Gratuity in salary is a financial component paid to the employees by the organizations recognizing their services. As part of the salary, it is a benefit aimed to help the employees during their post-retirement years. The amount is generally paid at the time of retirement; however, every employee who has worked for the company for five consecutive years is eligible to receive this benefit. How Does Gratuity Work? The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 governs this benefit. Implemented in 1972, the act aimed to cover people working in mines, plantations, factories, fields, ports, and other establishments for more than 10 years. According to the act, the entire amount is payable by the employer; however, employees can also contribute towards this payment to increase the accumulated corpus. Some organizations pay the benefit through the companies‚Äô resources while others may tie up with insurance providers for group plans. Moreover, the benefits depend on the terms and conditions of such plans. What Are the rules of Gratuity? The three important rules related to the timeline for the payment of this benefit are as follows: An employee must send an application to the company about the money due as this benefit. On receiving the application, the organization calculates the amount and replies to the employee and the controlling authority. The company has to pay the entire amount within 30 days from the date of sending the acknowledgment. Forfeiture Rules Employers reserve the right to forfeit this benefit partially or even fully if the employee has completed five years of consecutive services. However, this is only if the employee‚Äôs termination is due to disorderly behavior like physically harming others during their employment. Number of Employees Every organization that employs 10 or more people on a single day during the preceding 12 months is liable to pay this benefit. Even if the number of personnel reduces below 10, the company will still have to pay the benefit as per the rules of the act. Gratuity Eligibility Criteria As per the new gratuity rules, the following are the eligibility norms. Employees eligible for receiving superannuation Individuals who have completed at least five consecutive years of employment with the same organization Retiring personnel Any employee who passes away or faces disability due to an accident or ailment How to Calculate Gratuity? The amount is calculated based on the number of years of employment and the last drawn salary. Additionally, it varies among individuals covered and not covered under the act. Formula to calculate gratuity for employees covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 Companies that hire 10 or more people on a single day during the 12 preceding months are covered under the act. The formula to calculate the amount is as follows: Gratuity = (15 x last drawn salary x number of years of service) / 26 The last drawn salary includes the basic remuneration plus the dearness allowance (DA); no other component is included in the calculation Completed years means when you have worked for more than six months during the year Formula to calculate gratuity for employees not covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 The formula for calculating gratuity amount is as follows: Gratuity = (15 x average salary for previous 10 months x number of years employed) x 30 The last drawn salary includes the basic remuneration plus DA and any commissions The number of employment years includes only the completed years of service Formula to calculate gratuity for deceased employees The amount depends on the tenure of the service of the deceased employee subject to a maximum amount of INR 20 lakhs. The table below shows the amount payable to the beneficiaries of a deceased employee: Service tenure Amount payable Less than one year 2 x basic salary More than one year but less than five years 6 x basic salary More than five ",

    "question": "How To Choose Recurring Deposit Interest Rates from Top Banks",
    "answer": "What is Mid Cap Fund ‚Äì Overview, Features, Advantages & DisadvantagesOctober 10, 2022Recurring Deposit: Features, Benefits, Eligibility & Interest RatesNovember 24, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Recurring deposit interest rates are the rate of interest that is paid on deposits made into a recurring deposit account. The interest rate is usually fixed for the term of the deposit and can vary depending on the bank or financial institution. Recurring deposits typically have a higher interest rate than savings accounts but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals. Most banks and financial institutions offer a wide range of RD interest rates, so it is important to compare the rates before choosing an account. Recurring deposit rates can vary depending on the term of the deposit, the amount deposited, and the type of account. For example, some accounts may offer a higher recurring interest rate for a longer-term deposit, while others may offer a lower rate for a shorter-term deposit. It is also important to consider any fees or charges that may be associated with an account before choosing one. Overview of RD Interest Rates Particulars Details Interest Rate Range From 2.50 to 8.50 Minimum Deposit Amount Rs.10 (for post office RD) Tenure of the Investment 6 months to 10 years Interest Compound Frequency Quarterly Partial and Mid-term Withdrawal Not Allowed Premature Closure Allowed with a penalty *A post office recurring deposit can be started with as low as Rs. 10 RD interest rate is compounded quarterly. How to choose the best RD interest rates? The best RD interest rates will depend on your specific needs and goals. However, there are a few general tips that can help you choose the best rates: 1. Consider your time horizon: If you need the money sooner, you‚Äôll want to choose a shorter-term RD with lower interest rates. If you have more time, you can choose a longer-term RD and lock in higher interest rates. 2. Compare different banks and RDs: Some banks offer higher interest rates for longer terms, while others may have lower rates for shorter terms. It‚Äôs important to compare different banks‚Äô options before choosing an RD. 3. Keep an eye on the market: Interest rates are influenced by economic conditions. If interest rates are rising, you may want to lock in an RD now to avoid paying higher rates in the future. Conversely, if rates are falling, you may want to wait and see if you can get a better RD later on. 4. Compare RDs with other investment options: RDs are just one type of investment. Before choosing an RD, compare it with other options, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Each of the Investment options has its own set of pros and cons, so it‚Äôs important to understand all your options before investing. 5. Consider fees and taxes: Some RDs come with fees, such as account maintenance fees or early withdrawal penalties. And, depending on the type of RD, you may be subject to taxes on the interest you earn. Be sure to factor these into your decision before investing. These are just a few things to keep in mind when considering an RD. By doing your research and being aware of the potential risks, you can make sure that you‚Äôre making the best decision for your financial future. Current RD Interest Rates RD Interest Rates in all banks differ from one another. Many banks offer a good interest rate on recurring deposits. However, the best bank for recurring deposits may vary from person to person. It all depends on the individual‚Äôs needs and preferences. The highest RD interest rates are generally offered by large banks. However, smaller banks and credit unions may also offer competitive rates. It is always best to compare rates from different banks before deciding which one to choose. Below is a table for RD Interest Rates of different banks: Banks General Interest Rates % State Bank of India 4.40-5.50 ICICI 3.50-5.50 HDFC 4.40-5.50 Axis Bank 4.40-5.75 Punjab National Bank 4.40-5.30 When looking for RD Interest Rates in banks, it is important to consider other factors such as fees, customer service, and account minimums. These can all affect the overall experience of having a recurring deposit account. Types of RD schemes There are different types of RD schemes available in the market, each with its own set of features and benefits. The most popular RD schemes are 1. Fixed deposit RD scheme: In this type of scheme, the interest rate is fixed for the entire tenure of the deposit. This makes it easy to plan your fin",

    "question": "Personal Loan Foreclosure ‚Äì All You Need To Know",
    "answer": "GST on Personal Loans ‚Äì Its Impact & WorkingNovember 27, 2024Loan Against Mutual Funds: What is It? How to Get Loan Against Securities?November 27, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Personal loans are one of the most popular ways of managing finances for most people. They can be used for various purposes, such as funding education, covering wedding expenses, expanding business, dealing with medical emergencies, etc. Most people obtain a personal loan to finance their needs. Generally, a longer loan tenure means that the monthly EMI is less, but it also means that the cost of borrowing increases as we end up paying more interest over the loan period. But, if you have some extra money during the loan tenure, a great idea would be to pay off the existing loan before using it for any other purposes or investing it. It is a dilemma for most of us how to use the extra money, but paying off a personal loan early has many benefits. You just need to be aware of the penalties or early repayment charges and conditions of your loans. Personal loan foreclosure helps in saving money on interest charges. The details of what foreclosure of a personal loan is, charges, drawbacks of early repayments, how to repay a loan earlier, and itsdrawbacks are all discussed in this article. This information will help you decide what best suits you and aligns with your financial goals. What Is Foreclosure of Personal Loan? When you repay the entire amount of a personal loan earlier than the decided period, it is known as a personal loan foreclosure, or loan prepayment, or pre-closure. You can save on interest payments and reduce your financial burden if you opt for foreclosure of your personal loan. If you decide to pre-close your loan, make sure to review the terms and conditions of your loan, as there are certain foreclosure charges on personal loans. So, when you settle your loan account for foreclosure, the amount would include any outstanding principal amount, interest due till the foreclosure date and foreclosure charges as applicable. Remember to collect the No Objection Certificate from your lender as it is proof of foreclosure of your personal loan. Types of Foreclosure There are two types of personal loan foreclosures in India: Bank-Initiated Foreclosure: If you are irregular with your repayments or default on your EMI, the lender may initiate foreclosure of your personal loan. The lender will also send you a legal notice asking you to repay the outstanding balance. Customer-Initiated Foreclosure: When a customer is able to arrange money and decides to repay the loan earlier and become debt-free as part of their financial management, it is a customer-initiated foreclosure of a personal loan. Benefits of Foreclosure / Pre-closure of Personal Loan There are many advantages of foreclosure of a personal loan: Interest Savings: The interest charges on personal loans increase the cost of borrowing significantly. So, when you pay off a loan earlier, you can save a lot of money, which would have gone into the interest payment. So, interest savings is one of the biggest advantages of foreclosure of personal loans. Reduced Financial Burden: It is true that any loan taken comes with the stress of paying monthly EMIs and interest charges. So, if you have some extra income or cash and manage the foreclosure of your personal loan, you become debt-free earlier, and your financial burden is reduced. Increased Loan Eligibility: With the pre-closure of your personal loan, you do not have any other liabilities, so you are easily able to obtain a new loan when you need to. This increases your eligibility to avail of a new loan. Potential Drawbacks of Foreclosure / Pre-closure of a Personal Loan While foreclosure of personal loans does help you save money and become free of your debts sooner, it does have a few drawbacks, too. Some of the disadvantages of pre-closure of a personal loan are: Prepayment/Foreclosure Penalty: Foreclosure may involve foreclosure charges on personal loans or pre-closure penalties. You should consider these charges and penalties before deciding to foreclose your personal loan. Missed Investment Opportunities: When you have extra money, you have to choose between investing the money in mutual funds, stocks, SIPs, etc. or paying off your personal loan and becoming debt-free. When you decide to opt for foreclosure of your personal loan, you are losing on the investment opportunities and their potential returns. Loss of Tax Benefits: Some",

    "answer": "What Is Fixed and Variable Salary? Meaning, Differences and Ways to Calculate Your SalaryApril 9, 202511 Best RuPay Credit Card Lifetime Free in India 2025June 1, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle A salary increment letter is a formal request made by an employee to seek a pay raise. It emphasizes achievements, contributions, and justifications for the increase while maintaining a professional tone. This letter is an important tool for initiating a discussion about salary adjustments. What Is a Salary Increment Request Letter? A salary increment request letter is a formal document written by an employee to their employer, requesting an increase in their current salary. This letter typically outlines the employee‚Äôs contributions to the company, achievements, and reasons why they believe they deserve a raise. It‚Äôs important to be professional, specific, and persuasive in this letter. Benefits of Writing a Salary Increment Letter Writing a salary increment letter is a great way to make your request official. It starts the formal process of asking for a raise, which might not happen until the appraisal period otherwise. This letter also allows you to highlight your achievements and contributions at work. By listing your successes, you create a record that can be helpful in the future, even if your request for a raise doesn‚Äôt go through this time. Overall, it‚Äôs a valuable step that shows your commitment and professionalism. When Should You Write a Salary Increment Letter to Employee? Deciding when to write a salary increment letter can be a bit challenging. It‚Äôs important to think from your employer‚Äôs perspective to find the right moment. Here are some important points to consider for timing your request: When the Company Is Profitable: Before asking for a raise, check how well your company is doing financially. It‚Äôs best to request a salary increase when the organisation is experiencing strong profits. This can make your request more appealing, so look at recent financial reports to gauge the company‚Äôs performance. After Finishing a Major Project: A great time to ask for a raise is right after completing an important project. This gives you the chance to showcase your contributions and the impact you‚Äôve made. Employers are often more inclined to reward you when they see your efforts directly tied to a successful outcome. If You Missed a Scheduled Pay Raise: Many companies have regular employee reviews followed by pay raises. If you didn‚Äôt receive a raise during the last review, it might be appropriate to bring it up separately. Reviewing your last increment can help you decide how much to ask for this time. During Performance Reviews: If you‚Äôve been performing well, consider making your request during your performance review. This is when the company evaluates employees and discusses their accomplishments. You can use this opportunity to explain why you deserve a raise based on your solid performance. When Taking on Extra Responsibilities: If you‚Äôve taken on additional tasks or responsibilities without a promotion or pay increase, it‚Äôs reasonable to ask for a salary increment. Handling new duties well shows that you‚Äôre capable and committed, and your employer may recognise this with a raise. After Upgrading Your Skills: Many employees invest time in learning new skills or getting certifications to enhance their abilities. If you‚Äôve recently improved your qualifications, it‚Äôs a good time to ask for a salary increase. This not only boosts your confidence but also demonstrates the added value you bring to the company. Timing your request thoughtfully can make a significant difference in how your employer perceives it. By considering these factors, you‚Äôll be better prepared to make a strong case for your salary increment. What to Add to a Salary Increment Request Letter? When requesting a salary hike, here‚Äôs what you should include in your letter to the employer: Your name, employee ID, and designation Address and date Recipient‚Äôs name, company, and designation Request letter‚Äôs purpose Your joining date and years you‚Äôve worked in the company List of detailed accomplishments that deserve a raise The percentage and amount of hike you want Thank the recipient for their time How to write a Salary Increment Request Letter (With Examples & Downloadable PDF & Word Document)?

Lenders may use different techniques in the procedure of credit appraisal based on certain rules, norms, and standards. The evaluation process also determines the credit/loan structure, including the interest rate, based on lending rules. Eligibility for Credit Appraisal Different lending institutions usually have their own eligibility criteria. However, here are some common elements in the credit approval process ‚Äì Income Stability The credit appraisal eligibility is influenced by your income level, work history, and overall financial status. The lender gathers applicants‚Äô information to understand how likely a potential borrower is to make timely repayments. Credit History Financial organisations also use your credit history when evaluating your loan or credit card application because it reflects the borrower‚Äôs repayment track record. A person‚Äôs sound financial standing is shown by their credit history. Loan-to-Cost Ratio This measure assesses the relationship between the loan amount and the cost associated with the fund‚Äôs intended use. This is crucial in precisely calculating the loan or credit amount eligible for authorisation. Debt-to-Income Ratio This ratio assesses how much of a borrower‚Äôs income goes toward existing debt. A lower debt-to-income ratio indicates a smaller debt, which increases their eligibility for credit appraisal. Collateral Lenders assess the amount or value of collateral submitted by borrowers seeking secured loans as part of the credit assessment process before making a final decision. Collateral may be financial or physical, for example, a home, business, jewellery, land, machinery, or other similar assets. The Credit Appraisal Process Here are the steps to assess the creditworthiness of individuals in the credit appraisal process ‚Äì Application Review The first step is the application review where a preliminary screening is done to check if the application meets the basic criteria like income and age. The financial institutions carefully examine and verify all the information provided in the form, which is why it is critical to fill in details accurately and avoid errors. Documentation Post application review, personal and financial documents, such as proof of identification, bank statements, and address details among others, are verified. To save yourself trouble, submit the application together with the necessary supporting documents. Finance and Risk Assessment The bank or lender examines the repayment history of the applicant or potential borrower. The lender may assess present debt (if any) and other financial data to get an understanding of the borrower‚Äôs financial status and credit risk. This step is crucial in deciding whether the applicant is eligible for credit and also helps banks assess the risk of lending. Loan Structuring Once the applicant clears financial evaluation and risk evaluation, the lender decides on loan terms, which include the principal amount, interest rate, and repayment schedule. Approval and Administration The lender finally approves the loan once all conditions are met and procedures are completed. However, how long it takes for the reimbursement or credit appraisal to complete depends on the lender and the appraisal amount.

    "question": "12 Benefits of Personal Loan",
    "answer": "Salary Increment Letter to Employee: How To Write, Format & TemplatesNovember 8, 2024Tax Benefit on Personal LoanNovember 25, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle What do you do when you suddenly need money for an emergency like hospitalisation or when you have been delaying some necessary repair work in your house due to a cash crunch? A few things that are not very urgent can be delayed, but there are many things for which we need to arrange financing. Availing a personal loan in such instances has many benefits, and it is a great option for arranging money in a short time. The many benefits of a personal loan, such as quick disbursal, less paperwork, flexible repayment options, etc., make it an ideal choice for anyone needing financial assistance. The best part of a personal loan is that it has no specific end-use, so you can use it for any purpose you want to, such as covering wedding expenses, paying school or college fees, going on a holiday, buying a new car, medical emergencies, etc. Benefits of Personal Loan Personal loans are unsecured and can be used for various purposes. It is easy to get a personal loan, and most banks and financial institutions offer personal loans to customers. Some of the benefits of getting a personal loan are: The Process is Hassle-Free and Requires Less Documents The entire process of obtaining a personal loan is quick and can be completed online via the lender‚Äôs website or app or by visiting a local branch. A big advantage of personal loans is that they require minimal paperwork and documentation as compared to other loans. All you would need are ID proof, income proof, and address proof. Almost Instant Loan Disbursal A great benefit of a personal loan is how quickly you get the money once your loan is approved. It is possible to get funds within minutes of loan approval, which makes it easy to deal with emergency situations such as surgeries or hospitalisation. You can get a Loan Without Any Collateral A significant benefit of personal loans is that they do not require any collateral, as they are unsecured. This means you will not have to pledge your house or car to avail of a loan and risk losing a valuable asset. Lump-Sum Funding With personal loans, you get the sum of money you need upfront and lump-sum, unlike a credit card or line of credit. You are then free to use the amount as you wish, whether to pay off the contractor for house repairs, go on a family vacation, cover your child‚Äôs college fees, or for any other reason. No Specific End-Use of the Funds While a home loan or auto loan has specific uses and cannot be used for any other purposes, a personal loan‚Äôs advantage is that it does not have a specific end usage and so you can use the money borrowed for almost any purpose be it going on your dream vacation or expanding your business or anything else. As long as you use it for legal purposes, it is allowed. Tenure Flexibility This benefit of personal loans comes as a blessing for most people as it allows borrowers to choose their loan duration as per their repayment capacity. You can use an EMI calculator to find the instalment amount based on your preferred tenure and the prevailing interest rate. You can opt for a longer tenure when you want to pay a lesser EMI amount each month, depending on your budget. Easy Repayment Options Paying off a personal loan is also easy and flexible. Usually, a set date is decided before the loan has to be repaid, but you have the freedom to choose your loan tenure, and the terms of repayment are easy going. Sometimes, if you are able to arrange a large amount of money, you may also have the option of paying off your loan earlier. Helps To Improve Your Credit Score & History When you obtain a personal loan, you will need to pay regular and timely EMIs to pay off the loan. Such regular repayments and no defaults will help you maintain a high credit score and improve your credit history. With a high credit score, availing your next loan will become easier, and you can also get it at lower interest rates as you have proven your creditworthiness. Interest Rates are Low & Competitive Personal loans offer competitive interest rates. When your credit history is good, and you have a stable income, it is possible to get loans at lower interest rates. They are also more affordable than credit card loans or charges. Easy to Consolidate Debt If you have multiple debts or loans, you can take out a personal loan to pay off all the debt collectively using tha",

    "question": "What is PF in Salary ‚Äì Meaning, Full Form & Calculations in Employee Provident Fund",
    "answer": "Best Money Transfer Apps in India (With Play Store Ratings) ‚Äì Top 25 AppsApril 7, 2025Salary Certificate Format in Word and PDF: Free Downloadable TemplateApril 8, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle In salary terms, ‚ÄúPF‚Äù means Provident Fund‚Äîa retirement savings where both employee and employer contribute. In the realm of employment and remuneration, it is essential to understand the various components that make up an employee‚Äôs salary. This article aims to delve into the concept of PF in salary, explaining its types and PF eligibility. By gaining clarity on this topic, individuals can better comprehend their financial entitlements and plan for a secure future. What is PF in Salary? The Provident Fund (PF) is an important savings scheme for employees, aimed at providing financial security in the long run. By contributing to the PF, employees can build a retirement fund that helps cover living expenses after they stop working. This can include costs for healthcare or even leisure activities during retirement. Besides being a retirement fund, the PF can act as an emergency reserve. Under certain conditions, you can withdraw some or all of the money if you need it. Additionally, the money you put into the PF is tax-free up to ‚Çπ1.5 Lakhs under Section 80(C) of the Indian Income Tax Act, but this applies only if you choose the Old Tax Regime. As per the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Act, your contribution is limited to 12% of your salary and dearness allowance. Your employer matches this amount, but it‚Äôs worth noting that 8.33% of their contribution goes into the Employee Pension Scheme, while the remaining 3.67% is directed to your PF account. The PF is included in your Cost to Company (CTC), which is the total amount your employer spends on you, ensuring you have benefits for retirement. What are the Types of Provident Funds? Depending on your employment, different types of provident funds are available in India. They include: Statutory Provident Fund This provident fund type is primarily established for employees working for the government, railways, universities and educational institutions, and other specified entities. The eligible employees for this type of provident fund account earn interest rates, decided as per the government, on their savings. Recognised Provident Fund This provident fund type is for private sector employees from organisations with more than 20 employees. Such companies can either have their own PF account or join a government PF scheme. If the company chooses to have its own PF trust, they need approval from the CIT (Commissioner of Income Tax.) Unrecognised Provident Fund This type of PF is when the CIT does not approve the above case of recognised provident fund. Public Provident Fund PPF Public Provident Fund, is a type of PF open to the public. Anyone can invest in it. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the nature of your employment is. So, whether you are self-employed or salaried, you can invest in this PF scheme as long as you have the funds to invest. The tenure for PPF is about 15 years, and you can invest ‚Çπ500 to ‚Çπ1.5 Lakh yearly. How Does PF (Provident Fund) Work? Provident Fund (PF) is a retirement fund that helps salaried employees save money. Here‚Äôs how it works: Companies with more than 20 employees are required to provide Provident Fund (PF) benefits to their staff. Mandatory Contribution: If you earn less than ‚Çπ15,000 per month, it‚Äôs mandatory to be part of the EPF (Employees‚Äô Provident Fund) scheme. Voluntary Contribution: Those earning over ‚Çπ15,000 per month can still choose to participate in the PF scheme voluntarily. Contribution Rate: The minimum contribution rate is set at 12%, though you can contribute more voluntarily. However, your employer is not obligated to match any additional contributions beyond 12%. Benefits: Being a part of the EPF scheme gives you access to pension and insurance benefits under the Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme (EPS) and the Employees‚Äô Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI). Tax Benefits: Since EPF is categorised under the EEE (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) tax system, the maturity amount will be tax-free as long as you‚Äôve served for at least five continuous years. Withdrawal: You can withdraw your PF balance after retirement or under certain conditions, such as buying a house or medical emergencies. Transfer: In the unfortunate event of your death, your nominee has the right to withdraw your PF balance. Disadvantages: There are some disadvantages to be aware of. For example",

    "question": "How to Link Aadhaar Card With PAN Card? ‚Äì Steps To Link And Check the Status",
    "answer": "What is Credit Card Pin & How to Generate Credit Card PinAugust 16, 2024Aadhaar Card Update and/or CorrectionsAugust 22, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle If you‚Äôve been regularly following the news, you might have heard that it is now compulsory to link your PAN card with your Aadhaar card. The last date for linking your PAN and Aadhaar cards is June 30, 2023. However, you have ample time left, provided you begin the process early on. The Government of India has devised two key ways to go about it ‚Äì via SMS and the Income Tax e-filing website. Here‚Äôs a simple guide to help you link your PAN card with Aadhaar and meet the deadline with ease. Why You Need to Link Your PAN Card With Aadhaar Card There are three main reasons to link PAN with Aadhaar card: If your PAN card is not linked with Aadhaar, it will be deactivated after June 30, 2021! Your income tax return (ITR) form will not be processed without your 12-digit Aadhaar number. In addition, linking your PAN with Aadhaar gives you the following advantages: You get a summarised detail of your taxes on a single page by logging onto the Income Tax portal. You won‚Äôt have to dispatch a separate IT verification form on the e-filing website. Rather, you can e-verify your returns using your Aadhaar card. How to check my Aadhaar card is linked with PAN card? You can check whether your PAN Card and Aadhaar Card are already linked. Follow the steps mentioned below: The first step is to visit the e-filing Income Tax Department page. Enter both your PAN and Aadhaar Number. Click on the ‚ÄòView Link Aadhaar Status‚Äô button. The status of your Aadhaar-PAN link status will appear on your screen. If your cards are linked, you do not have to worry. However, if the details on your Aadhaar and PAN cards do not match, then you first need to correct this. When Your Aadhaar and PAN Card Details Don‚Äôt Match It is simple to link your PAN and Aadhaar card when the details on both cards match. However, in some cases, they do not match. For example, your name might not be spelt the same way on both cards. To make sure they match, you will need to take action based on which card has the incorrect information. To make changes to your Aadhaar card, you will need to visit an Aadhaar Enrolment Centre. To make changes to the PAN card, the process is easier, as it is online. You can visit the NSDL PAN portal to make the changes. How to Make Changes to Your PAN Card Here‚Äôs a step-wise guide to correcting the information on your PAN card. Visit the NSDL website, which redirects to the exact page from which you can correct name details. Under the ‚ÄòApply Online‚Äô tab, select your application type as ‚ÄòChanges or Correction in existing PAN Data‚Äô from the drop-down menu. Select your category as ‚ÄòINDIVIDUAL‚Äô. Fill in the required details and upload signed digital documents that support the updation of PAN details. When your PAN details are correct, you shall receive an intimation via NSDL over email. How to Make Changes to Your Aadhaar Card Here‚Äôs a step-wise guide to correcting the information on your Aadhaar card. While you can rectify the details on your PAN card online, this isn‚Äôt possible for your Aadhaar card. Instead, you need to physically visit your nearest Aadhaar Enrolment Centre. A quick search on the UIDAI website will help you locate the nearest one. Carry a self-attested copy of identity proof with you. Fill out the Aadhaar Enrolment Form and submit it along with all the required documents. Don‚Äôt forget to ask for the acknowledgement slip that contains the update request number (URN), and keep it safe with you. Take a photograph to be on the safer side. You can log in with the URN to check the status of your update request. Click on the ‚ÄòCheck Online Demographics Update Status‚Äô option under the ‚ÄòUpdate Your Aadhaar‚Äô menu. Once redirected to the following page, fill in the details accordingly. Once the information on both documents is correct and matches, you can now link your Aadhaar with your PAN card. Link Aadhaar Card With PAN Through e-Filing Website The first step is to visit the official Income Tax e-filing website. Click on the ‚ÄòLink Aadhaar‚Äô option under quick links. Next, enter both your PAN card and Aadhaar number. Type your name as it is spelt on your Aadhaar card. If only the date of birth is written on your Aadhaar card, then you have to tick on the square. Next, tick the ‚ÄòI agree to validate my Aadhaar details with UIDAI‚Äô box. Carefully type the captcha code as it appears in the image ",

Educational Loans Education loans are explicitly designed to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and other educational costs for students pursuing a higher education. Many countries, including India, have mechanisms in place to offer subsidised rates on such loans. Business Term Loan While not designed for personal use, business term loans can be considered retail loans when you seek money for modest entrepreneurial endeavours.

Whether through online platforms or physical locations, there are numerous avenues available to sell these preloved items, and the best part is that almost anything can be sold.

Withdraw Cash from Your Credit Card In today‚Äôs world, credit cards have become a commonplace financial tool for almost everyone.

Furthermore, you can even withdraw cash from ATMs, similar to a debit card. However, it‚Äôs important to note that credit card withdrawals, technically known as credit card advances, differ slightly from debit card withdrawals. While you can withdraw cash using your credit card, there is a limit imposed by your bank, as the primary function of a credit card is to facilitate transactions rather than cash withdrawals. It‚Äôs advisable to check with your bank to confirm if this feature is available to you. Additionally, it‚Äôs crucial to keep in mind that there are additional charges and interest applied to the withdrawn amount, making it essential to manage your credit card advances responsibly. 5.

    "question": "How to Save Money",
    "answer": "How to Add/Register and Link Your Mobile Number With Aadhaar CardAugust 23, 2024What is CVV in a Credit Card?August 23, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Life is uncertain, and the COVID-19 pandemic has given a reality check to the entire world. Millions of people across the globe have lost their jobs and faced medical emergencies, leaving them with huge debt and monetary constraints. Financial challenges can significantly increase your stress levels. Therefore, saving for the future is important than ever. Being in charge of your spending habits and savings can help prevent distress. So, here are some of the best ways to save money. 10 best ways to save money Wondering how to save money? Well, it is an art mastered by a few. One common excuse most people give for not saving is that their salaries are low. However, saving even 10% of your salary each month can add to your overall financial stability in the long term. Budget your money Determining a budget is one of the most important things to follow. Prepare a monthly budget and adhere to it. Although it may seem cumbersome, it is one of the best ways to save money. The budget allows you to keep track of your expenses and avoid unnecessary expenditures. The money saved can then be invested to build wealth. Save money through health insurance You may wonder how to save money from salary by purchasing a health insurance plan. However, it is possible when you pay an annual premium. It is beneficial to pay the premium rather than spend a huge amount due to an accident or sudden illness requiring hospitalization. Keep debt under control If you have one or more loans, a one-time restructuring to settle smaller loans is beneficial. The money saved can be invested for future growth. If you have a larger loan, you may make partial prepayments by using your bonus or other surpluses to reduce the tenure. This helps saves the interest outflow. Divide your salary wisely You may request the human resource (HR) department to pay your salary in your savings and checking accounts separately. When you deposit money in the savings account regularly and do not spend it, you can save a huge amount over the years. Moreover, the rate of interest on savings accounts is higher when compared to other types of accounts. Lower your electricity bill Want to know how to save money at home? Reduce your electricity bill. Compared to regular bulbs, LED and compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) bulbs are more energy-efficient and last longer, which helps save money. Plugged-in electronic devices consume electricity; therefore, unplugging these when not in use is recommended. Moreover, seal your home to avoid loss of air, which can significantly add to the electricity bill. Avoid late payment fees Lack of planning may result in unnecessary late payment fees, which can reduce your income. Using an app to remind you of payment due dates and enabling autopay help to avoid these penalties and save money. Use money management apps Using a money management app is one of the best tips on how to save money. The app ensures all your bills and other dues are paid on time. It also helps you pay off outstanding dues and build a realistic plan for your monthly savings and expenditure. However, being disciplined is important to maximize the benefits of such an app. Save on transportation costs Using your vehicle for daily commute can be convenient; however, with the skyrocketing fuel prices, it can also be quite expensive. You can save a significant amount by opting for alternative ways to travel. To reduce fuel costs and maintenance expenses, use public transportation. Moreover, consider carpooling to the office and back or use shared cabs to reduce your travel expenses. Cut down the entertainment expenses Now, how is this the best way to save money? With various over-the-top (OTT) platforms, you may rarely watch anything on cable television. So, you may cancel your cable connection or pay only for the channels you watch regularly to save money. Moreover, most newspapers and magazines have free online apps, so canceling subscriptions to these can help reduce your costs. You may also discontinue the memberships for recreational activities that you do not use regularly. Further, booking movie tickets online can help save money via special offers. Prepare a budget for miscellaneous expenses Miscellaneous expenses include impulse purchases, home and auto repairs, and maintenance costs, and much more. You must estimate the budge",

You will have to follow some steps and rules, and your decision to switch will have consequences. Read to learn more about switching in mutual funds, its benefits, and factors to consider before switching. What is switch in mutual funds?

Visit the AMC‚Äôs website and complete the switch online. Use independent mutual fund platforms that let you switch investments easily through their portals. For investments below ‚Çπ2 lakh, the switch is usually processed on the same day if you initiate it before 3 pm. However, if the amount is above ‚Çπ2 lakh, it might take a couple of days to transfer the units to the new scheme.

You will first need to redeem your units from the current fund. Once the redemption is complete and you receive the money, you can invest it in the new mutual fund scheme.

    "question": "Credit Card Fraud Detection: How to Protect Your Finances in India",
    "answer": "Guide to Tax-Saving Investments AvenuesAugust 22, 20245 Best Credit Card for Utility Bill Payment in India 2025August 22, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Credit cards have become a staple in our financial lives with benefits from payment flexibility and cash withdrawal to rewards and travel benefits. But did you know that financial fraud in India has been on the rise, with credit card fraud being one of the most prevalent? According to a report by the Reserve Bank of India, during the fiscal year ending March 2024, cyber fraud in India grew by 14.57 billion rupees ($175 million) in a year. This makes it crucial for cardholders to be aware of the risks and protective measures available. In this guide, we aim to help you get a better understanding of what credit card fraud is, the types of credit card fraud, and some of the most effective credit card fraud detection techniques. Let‚Äôs read. What Is Credit Card Fraud? Credit card fraud is when someone hacks your credit card information like the passcode, card number, etc, and uses these details to make purchases or transactions without your consent. Often, physical theft of the card can lead to credit card fraud. Several techniques and technologies can also be used to hack credit cards; criminals can digitally acquire card details required to make a transaction. An individual‚Äôs personal information and card details may be compromised as the result of a data breach or cyberattack. Therefore, knowledge about credit card fraud detection is critical for all credit card users. Types of Credit Card Fraud Credit card frauds fall under two main categories ‚Äì card-present fraud and card-not-present fraud. Let‚Äôs read about both in detail. 01 Card-Present Fraud This is a typical case of stealing where someone has your credit card and decides to use it at a physical outlet. As the name says, the card is present, which means that the card is either stolen or duplicated. Lost or Stolen Cards This is a theft where a criminal gets hold of the physical card and uses it until the card is either frozen or has hit the credit limit. In this case, the card may have been stolen or lost. In case you decide to stop using a credit card, make sure to cut or cancel it before discarding it. Credit Card Application Fraud This type of credit card fraud is a growing concern. It is the result of your personal information or documents being stolen to get a credit card under your name. Moreover, this credit card fraud may go unnoticed until you apply for credit or check your credit report. So, always make sure to shred the copies of your IDs and other necessary documents before discarding them. Hacking This is the type of stealing where hackers use advanced technology and methods to hack your credit card information or the bank database. This may also involve data leaks from websites or payment gateways. So, always be careful when sharing your card details on the web. 02 L Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud In a card-not-present fraud, the criminal uses card details like card number, CVV, and the account holder‚Äôs name to make transactions online. Credit Card Skimming In this method of stealing, the fraudster uses a skimmer at the payment point to read or record details like card numbers and PINs. This is quite common at frequented payment points like ATMs and petrol stations. This type of hacking is extremely sophisticated and is very hard to notice. Phishing This is a form of credit card fraud where hackers send emails or texts with links to fraudulent websites to get cardholders to share their personal details. The fraudsters use look-alike websites to coax users into sharing their information. Account Takeover In an account takeover, a fraudster may pretend to be the legitimate cardholder and change information like phone number and password to get illegal access to the account. This will allow them to authenticate transactions through a simple OTP or one-time password. In India, with the increasing use of digital banking, account takeover frauds are becoming more common. What Is Credit Card Fraud Detection? Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying fraud before it causes much harm to you both financially and emotionally. It includes the use of tools, methods, practices, and policies by financial organisations to combat this problem. With the advancements in technology, we are witnessing a wide use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technology in the credit card fraud detection",

    "question": "HRA in Salary ‚Äì What is It? Calculations & Formula",
    "answer": "Everything You Need to Know About Credit Card Balance TransferSeptember 12, 2024Advance Tax ‚Äì Meaning, Benefits, Formula, And Easy StepsSeptember 13, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle If you have ever checked the salary breakdown section on your pay slip, you must have noticed House Rent Allowance (HRA). But what is HRA and how does it benefit you? Read on to understand everything you need to know about this allowance. What is HRA? HRA is an essential part of the salary paid by employers to their employees. The company pays the amount as an allowance for your annual house rent, and it comes with tax benefits. The employers decide the HRA amount depending on your city of residence and salary. The tax benefit of HRA comes under Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, but it pertains to specific provisions. Moreover, you can enjoy the HRA benefits only if you live in a rented house. People living in their own homes are not eligible to claim HRA tax exemption. Eligibility criteria to claim HRA tax deduction Before you can claim HRA deduction, make sure if you are eligible. Here is a list of criteria you must meet: You must be a salaried individual You should be living in a rented house Your salary slip should include the HRA section Benefits of HRA The key benefit of HRA is that it reduces your taxable income. Thus, you have a lower tax liability when your company pays the allowance. Additionally, it relieves the financial burden as the amount covers your entire or at least a part of the rent. HRA exemption rules If you live in your own house, you cannot claim the exemption. You must submit the rent receipts as proof to avail of the tax exemption. You can get the HRA exemption if you are paying rent to your parents as long as you submit the relevant receipts. You are not eligible to receive the tax benefit by paying rent to your spouse as the Income Tax Act, 1961 does not allow it. If you pay over INR 1 lakh as annual rent, it is mandatory to submit the permanent account number (PAN) card details of your landlord. If you live in a metro city (Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, or Chennai), you are eligible to get 50% (Basic salary + Dearness Allowance) of your basic salary as HRA, while it is 40% (Basic salary + Dearness Allowance) for non-metro cities. How to calculate HRA? HRA exemption = Minimum of: Actual HRA received OR 50% or 40% of (Basic salary + Dearness Allowance) OR Actual rent paid ‚Äì 10% of (Basic salary + Dearness Allowance) Example: If you live in Delhi (a metro city), your Basic salary is ‚Çπ30,000, your Dearness Allowance is ‚Çπ10,000, your actual HRA received is ‚Çπ20,000, and your actual rent paid is ‚Çπ25,000, then your HRA exemption would be: Option 1: Actual HRA received = ‚Çπ20,000 Option 2: 50% of (Basic salary + Dearness Allowance) = 50% of (30,000 + 10,000) = ‚Çπ20,000 Option 3: Actual rent paid ‚Äì 10% of (Basic salary + Dearness Allowance) = 25,000 ‚Äì 10% of (30,000 + 10,000) = ‚Çπ22,000 Since the least amount is ‚Çπ20,000, your HRA exemption would be ‚Çπ20,000. Calculate your HRA in seconds Easily calculate your HRA in seconds without the worry of calculating in manually.. Calculate your HRA in seconds Documents required for HRA exemption 1. Rent receipts, which include the below details: Landlord‚Äôs name Your name Date Address of the rented property Duration of stay Revenue stamp with the landlord‚Äôs signature 2. The landlord‚Äôs PAN details and a copy of the PAN card if your annual rent exceeds INR 1 lakh When do you need the landlord‚Äôs PAN card? If you are currently paying more than INR 1 lakh in rent per year, you must provide your landlord‚Äôs PAN details to get the HRA tax deduction. Failing to do so will result in the loss of the tax benefit. However, if your landlord does not have a PAN card, ask them to provide you with a declaration as per circular No. 8/2013 dated 10th October 2013. Additionally, if you are paying the rent to a Non-resident Indian (NRI) landlord, you need to deduct 30% tax deducted at source (TDS) while making the payment. How to claim tax benefits on both HRA and home loan? The HRA rules only allow you the tax exemption if you are currently living in rented accommodation. But what happens if you are staying in a rented place and have also rented out your own property? The income tax regulations allow you to get tax benefits on both HRA and home loans. In this scenario, you must disclose your income from rent and pay the required taxes to avail of the tax benefits. But you cannot claim benefits on both",

    "question": "What Is a Debit Card? Applying Online and Other Important Information",
    "answer": "What Is UPI Payment and How Does UPI Work?June 14, 2024Pre-approved Personal Loans ‚Äì What is It, Eligibility, and Document RequirementsJune 14, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Debit cards became popular in the early 1980s, ushering a slow but sure revolution in the world of banking and finance. Today, after decades of making their first appearance, debit cards remain popular and very much in use. Presently, there‚Äôs a wide variety of debit cards offered by various banks. If you‚Äôre thinking of applying for a new debit card, this post will help you understand the benefits of using one and acquaint you with the different options available. What Is a Debit Card? A debit card is a payment card that allows you to transfer money electronically from your bank to pay for purchases instead of using cash. You can also use a debit card to withdraw cash at ATMs and access internet and mobile banking services. Besides making it convenient to purchase items without physical cash, some banks also allow you to use your debit card to buy big-ticket items and convert the expenditure into easy EMIs for budgeting. Several debit cards are available in India, issued by various banks, and associated with different offers and discounts. Most banks offer different categories of debit cards as well. Premium cards usually attract more fees and might provide more reward points and other lifestyle features. Types of Debit Cards in India Let‚Äôs get acquainted with the six types of debit cards offered by various Indian banks. 1. Visa Debit Cards Visa debit cards are quite popular in the Indian market. They belong to Visa, a financial services corporation headquartered in the USA. Enhanced security for online transactions is the main reason behind the popularity of Visa debit cards. Depending on your net worth and ongoing promotions at your bank, you might also be eligible for a Visa Platinum Debit Card that comes with extra privileges compared to a basic Visa card. For instance, holders of debit cards in the Platinum category can use the 24-hour concierge services provided by Visa to make online reservations and purchases. 2. Visa Electron Debit Cards Visa Electron debit cards are similar to Visa debit cards, but they lack the overdraft feature. This means that a Visa Electron card must have the funds available at the time of transfer. On the contrary, a Visa debit card generally allows transfers exceeding the available funds up to a specific limit. For the same reason, Visa Electron cards are mostly issued to younger people or those with poor credit. Some people also prefer a Visa Electron debit card because of the lower fees associated with them. Unfortunately, some online and offline stores may not support this type of card as they cannot check for the availability of funds. 3. MasterCard Debit Cards MasterCard is another America-based company and one of the biggest card providers in the Indian market. MasterCard debit cards are accepted globally and provide uninterrupted banking services, including a 24-hour toll-free customer service helpline. MasterCard debit cards are available in several ranges. The card you are issued will depend on your bank as well as the balance you hold. The three popular types of MasterCard debit cards are: Standard Enhanced World Most banks tend to issue a standard MasterCard debit card when you open an account with them. 4. Contactless Debit Cards Both Visa and MasterCard offer contactless debit cards powered by Near-Field Communication technology (NFC). These cards provide an easy way to make payments by simply tapping the card on a Point of Sale (PoS) machine. In India, RBI allows transactions of less than INR 2,000 to be processed without a PIN (Personal Identification Number). As a result, many banks have started offering contactless debit cards, which are convenient for small purchases. 5. Maestro Debit Card All banks in India except ICICI Bank issue Maestro Debit Cards. These cards are obtained from associate banks and linked to their current account. You can use Maestro cards at PoS systems and ATMs, along with contactless payments. Maestro cards also offer good security and global services, making them a popular option. 6. RuPay Debit Cards RBI launched RuPay debit cards in 2012 in the Indian market to enable risk-free online and PoS transactions. Apart from the leading private and public sector banks, RuPay cards are also issued by the various cooperative and regional rural banks in India. In addition to afford",

    "answer": "Credit Card Disadvantages and Advantages: Everything Should KnowJanuary 12, 20258 Best RuPay Fuel Credit Cards in India 2025January 23, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle Getting a personal loan can feel like a mountain to climb, especially if your CIBIL score isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd like it to be. But don‚Äôt worry; there are apps out there that are willing to help, even if your credit score isn‚Äôt perfect. Think of these apps as friendly neighbors who understand that sometimes life throws us curveballs, and they‚Äôre ready to lend a hand. These personal loan apps know that just because your score isn‚Äôt high doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not responsible with your money. Instead of focusing solely on numbers, they consider your overall financial situation and offer you a chance to borrow what you need. So, whether you‚Äôre looking to cover an unexpected bill or wanting to make a worthwhile investment, these apps can provide a solution. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how these loan apps work and what steps you need to follow to get that much-needed support. What is a CIBIL Score and Why Does It Matter? A CIBIL score is essentially a numerical representation of how well you manage debt and repay loans. It reflects your past credit behavior and is a key factor that lenders consider when evaluating your creditworthiness. This score is provided by CIBIL, which stands for Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, and is widely recognized by financial institutions. Lenders look at this CIBIL score to decide whether to approve your loan application. If you‚Äôve missed payments or defaulted on loans, it can lower your score, making it more challenging to secure funding in the future. On the flip side, maintaining a good CIBIL score can help you get better loan offers, including lower interest rates. In short, it‚Äôs important to stay on top of your payments and manage your credit responsibly, as this score plays a huge role in your financial life.

    "answer": "What Is Minimum Amount Due in Credit Card?August 16, 2024How to Link Aadhaar Card With PAN Card? ‚Äì Steps To Link And Check the StatusAugust 21, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle A credit card is a financial tool that enables users to borrow money from their bank to cover essential expenses, allowing for repayment at a later date. It provides a line of credit for making necessary payments. Obtaining a credit card is relatively easy, but maintaining one requires careful management. Your credit card usage directly impacts your financial health and future borrowing eligibility. To effectively manage your credit card, it‚Äôs important to understand how to use it properly and familiarise yourself with common terms and their applications. Let‚Äôs start by exploring what a Credit Card PIN is. What is a Credit Card PIN? A credit card PIN (Personal Identification Number) is a four-digit code used to confirm the identity of the cardholder. Entering this PIN is essential to complete any transaction. When you use your credit card, you‚Äôre prompted to enter your PIN, which authorises the payment. Once entered, the system verifies the PIN against your user ID to process the transaction. This step ensures that only you can authorise payments, adding a layer of security to your credit card use. For this reason, keeping your PIN confidential is crucial to protect your account from fraudulent activities. How to Generate Credit Card PIN? When you receive your new credit card, you will receive a welcome kit from the issuer. Inside, there‚Äôs a confidential document containing your PIN. While you can use this PIN for your initial transactions, changing it as soon as possible is important. Also, never share your PIN with anyone to protect your account from misuse. There are many ways in which you can generate a credit card PIN, including: 01 Through Internet Banking Log in to your internet banking account using your credentials. Go to the ‚ÄòCredit Card‚Äô section and select ‚ÄòChange PIN.‚Äô Verify your action with the OTP sent to your registered mobile number. Enter your new PIN twice and click ‚ÄòSubmit.‚Äô 02 Through Mobile Application Log in to your bank‚Äôs or credit card issuer‚Äôs mobile banking app. Navigate to the ‚ÄòCredit Card‚Äô section and select ‚ÄòChange PIN.‚Äô Verify your identity by entering the OTP sent to your registered mobile number.

Go to the ‚ÄòCredit Card PIN change‚Äô section. Enter your credit card details, including the card number, CVV, and expiry date. Input your new PIN twice and click ‚ÄòSubmit.‚Äô 04 Through Email Draft an email requesting your bank‚Äôs officials to generate a PIN for your credit card. Send the email to the official email address of your bank. After receiving your email, the bank officials will contact you with further instructions. 05 Through ATM Visit the nearest ATM and insert your credit card. Select the option ‚ÄòCreate PIN using OTP‚Äô from the menu. Enter the OTP sent to your registered mobile number. Input your new 4-digit PIN. Re-enter the PIN and click ‚ÄòSubmit.‚Äô 06 Through Customer Care If you‚Äôre not comfortable using net banking, an ATM, or a mobile app, you can always contact your bank‚Äôs customer care to generate or change your credit card PIN. The customer care executive will walk you through the process, providing guidance and assistance to help you securely create or update your PIN. 07 Visit the Bank‚Äôs Branch Visit your nearest bank branch and connect with a relevant official. Submit your request for credit card PIN generation. The bank will verify your details and process your request. How to Protect Your Credit Card Pin Once you have generated your credit card‚Äôs PIN, it‚Äôs time to take the right steps to protect it and avoid being scammed. Here are some of the best practices to protect your card PIN: Use a Strong PIN Steer clear of simple or easily guessable PINs, like 1234 or your birth year. Instead, opt for a random combination of numbers that would be challenging for anyone to figure out. A strong tip is to avoid keeping numbers that are either your birthdate or anniversaries. Memorise Your PIN Rather than writing it down on a physical or digital notepad, memorising your PIN is better. This is a great tip to avoid accidentally sharing your PIN with anyone.

    "answer": "How to Calculate Professional Tax on Salary?May 16, 2024Best Government Investment Schemes to Invest In 2025May 24, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Salary and pension are considered essential rights of an individual‚Äôs life and liberty under the Indian Constitution. When you receive your income statement on payday, you often come across the term ‚Äúbasic salary / basic pay‚Äù highlighted. In this article, we will learn what is basic salary, and its calculation methods, factors affecting it, and its tax implications. Let‚Äôs explore this crucial component of your salary structure in detail. What is Basic Salary? Basic salary refers to a fixed amount paid to employees for their services rendered to a company. It serves as the foundation upon which most other salary components are calculated. Unlike bonuses or commissions, a basic salary does not include any additional allowances. The determination of an employee‚Äôs basic salary takes place at the time of appointment and may be subject to revision annually, particularly if the individual falls under a pay scale system. The payable basic salary varies depending on factors such as the employee‚Äôs designation, industry, and experience. Basic Salary Calculation: How to Calculate Basic Salary? To understand the concept of basic salary, employees need to be aware that it forms a vital part of their salary structure, on which various components such as PF (Provident Fund), gratuity, etc., are calculated. Companies typically use simple formulas for calculating basic salary. The formula for Calculating Annual Basic Salary is: Annual basic salary = monthly basic salary X 12 months However, it‚Äôs important to note that there is no definitive method to calculate the basic wage, as it may vary from one company to another. In practice, companies often use a reversed calculation method based on a percentage of the overall salary or CTC (Cost to Company). The basic pay is usually set at around 40% of the gross income or 50% of an individual‚Äôs CTC. Another approach to finding the basic pay is by subtracting the total allowances (such as HRA, health insurance, DA, conveyance, etc.) from the gross pay: Basic salary = Gross pay ‚Äì total allowances Alternatively, the basic salary can be calculated as a percentage of the CTC or gross pay. Online CTC calculators can be helpful in determining your salary after deducting all the necessary components without seeking assistance from anyone. Check the ‚ÄòBasic Salary‚Äô section in the salary calculator below: Ôªø How To Calculate Basic Salary As CTC Percentage? When the exact basic pay remains unknown, but the CTC and the percentage of basic pay in the CTC are known, employees can reverse-engineer their basic salary with ease. By employing the following formula, they can ascertain the value of their base salary using the percentage provided: Basic salary = Total CTC x % of Basic Salary in CTC Basic Salary Calculation Examples Suppose an employee‚Äôs annual CTC amounts to ‚Çπ10 lakhs, with the basic salary calculated at 50%. By utilizing the formula, we will calculate the basic salary in the following manner: Basic salary: = ‚Çπ10 lakhs x 50% = ‚Çπ5 lakhs What Are the Factors Affecting Basic Salary? 5 factors influence the determination of basic salary in India. Some of the key factors include: HR Policies: HR policies established by an organization can have a significant impact on the basic salary structure. Depending on these policies, a skilled employee may receive higher compensation compared to colleagues at the same level. Company Policy: Companies often set salary brackets based on factors such as market demand and supply, company turnover, product/service offerings, and more. For example, the basic salary offered by an IT firm will differ from that of a small content-writing firm. Designation: An employee‚Äôs designation plays a vital role in determining the basic pay. Individuals with experience and qualifications are likely to receive a better pay scale than their counterparts with less experience or qualifications. Location or Country: Social and economic factors specific to a location or country can also contribute to salary discrepancies. For instance, the basic salary in India may differ significantly from that in Europe due to varying living costs and economic conditions. Industry or Sector: Different industries or sectors often have varying salary structures. The base salary of an individual working in the media sector, for instance, will differ from that of so",

    "question": "Difference Between Direct and Regular Mutual Funds",
    "answer": "Everything You Need To Know About A Joint Demat AccountMay 23, 2023How PF Is Calculated? A Step-by-Step GuideJune 23, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Mutual funds come in two versions direct and regular plans. In a direct plan, you purchase the mutual fund directly from the fund house or asset management company (AMC). Hence there is no intermediary involved. In the case of a regular plan, a broker or distributor gets involved, and you purchase your mutual fund from them. The AMC pays a small fee to these intermediaries, which is recovered by charging a higher expense ratio from the investor. The expense ratio is the fee you pay the fund house to manage your investments. Both have their own set of advantages and limitations. Read to find out the differences between direct and regular mutual funds and which one is better. What are direct mutual funds? Direct mutual funds are a type of mutual funds offered directly by the fund house, without any involvement of a third party, such as brokers and distributors. Since there are no intermediaries involved, there are additional commissions or brokerage. Hence, the expense ratio of this plan is lower compared to a regular plan. You can purchase a direct plan online or offline. Along with AMC‚Äôs several online platforms, such as Jupiter Money and Groww, are offering direct mutual funds to investors. The primary advantage of a direct plan in a mutual fund is that the expenses are low compared to a regular plan. Hence the returns are slightly higher in the long term. However, with direct plans, you must manage your mutual fund portfolio. You are responsible for reviewing, monitoring, and rebalancing your portfolio regularly. Moreover, you must spend a lot of time on research to review the performance of your mutual funds. What are regular mutual funds? The fund house offers regular plans in mutual funds through aggregators such as distributors, advisors, and brokers. To invest in regular funds, you need not go to the AMC. Instead, you can approach these intermediaries who will help you invest in the mutual funds that best suit you. They will assess your goals, investment horizon, and risk tolerance level and suggest funds. The intermediaries also offer regular portfolio monitoring and rebalancing. Investing in regular plans is very convenient as the intermediaries will take care of your investments for you. However, they charge a small fee, increasing the total expense of investing. Hence the returns of regular plans are slightly lower than direct plans. Differences between direct and regular mutual funds Following are the key differences between the direct and regular plans. Criteria Direct Plan Regular Plan Intermediary No intermediaries are present between AMC and the investor Brokers, distributors, and advisors sell mutual funds on behalf of the AMC Commission No intermediaries, hence no commission The commission is paid to intermediaries by the AMC Expense ratio No commission, so the expense ratio is low High expense ratio as a commission is paid Returns Slightly higher due to low expense ratio Low returns due to a high expense ratio Capital Appreciation Capital appreciation is high as the expenses are low Capital appreciation is affected due to the high expense ratio Who can invest Experienced investors with the market knowledge New investors and investors who lack time to review their portfolios regularly Which are better regular or direct mutual funds? Direct and regular plans are two different options of the same mutual funds. Both plans have the same fund manager, portfolio, and asset allocation. However, the direct plan has a low expense ratio and high NAV (net asset value) than the regular plan. It is difficult to tell which one is better than the other as both direct and regular plans have their own pros and cons. The direct plan gives slightly higher returns than the regular plan due to lower expenses. However, if you invest in this plan, you must manage your own investments. From research to investing, monitoring, and rebalancing, you must do everything independently. To invest in a direct plan, you must have the market knowledge and the time to regularly monitor your portfolio. Hence direct plans best suit investors who can manage their own investments. On the other hand, you don‚Äôt need any market knowledge for regular plans. Moreover, the intermediaries will do the research and portfolio review for you. They also ensure that your paperwork, bank mandate, and KYC is",

    "question": "How to Get a Personal Loan on Low CIBIL Score?",
    "answer": "Recession ‚Äì What Is It? What Causes It?September 25, 2024Gold Loan vs Personal Loan ‚Äì Which is Better & Why?September 26, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Personal loans are a go-to solution when you need extra funds for anything from medical emergencies to wedding expenses or even a dream vacation. They offer flexibility and come without strict restrictions on how you can use the money. However, securing a personal loan isn‚Äôt always straightforward, especially if your CIBIL score is on the lower side. Your CIBIL score plays a big role in whether or not lenders feel comfortable giving you a loan. While a lower score can make things a bit harder, it doesn‚Äôt mean all hope is lost. There are still ways to improve your chances of approval. In this article, we‚Äôll walk through how you can secure a personal loan with a low CIBIL score and what you can do to boost your odds. Let‚Äôs get started! What is a CIBIL score? Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number, ranging from 300 to 900, that shows lenders how reliable you are with credit. It‚Äôs based on things like your past loans, credit card usage, and how timely you‚Äôve been with repayments. The higher your score, the more confident lenders feel about lending to you, which can lead to better loan options and lower interest rates. What is a Low CIBIL Score? A CIBIL score below 650 is considered low, and this can make getting a loan a bit tricky. Lenders may see it as a sign of risk, which means you might face higher interest rates or even loan rejections. But don‚Äôt worry, as having a low score doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get a loan, it just means you‚Äôll need to be more strategic. Importance of Maintaining a Good CIBIL Score Keeping a good CIBIL score, ideally above 750, makes life easier when it comes to borrowing. Not only does it open the door to better interest rates and larger loan amounts, but it also gives you access to a wider range of credit options, whether it‚Äôs a personal loan or even a home loan. A good score shows that you‚Äôre responsible with money, helping you avoid the hassle of high rates and limited loan choices. By keeping an eye on your score and making efforts to improve it, you set yourself up for better financial opportunities down the road. How to Get Personal Loan with Low CIBIL Score While having a low CIBIL score can be a barrier, there are several strategies to increase your chances of getting a personal loan. Here‚Äôs how you can approach it: Go for Alternative Lenders (NBFCs) Instead of sticking with traditional banks, look into Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). They often have more flexible criteria for lending, making it easier for those with lower CIBIL scores to secure a loan. Just remember, they might charge higher interest rates, so weigh that against your needs. Provide Collateral or Secure a Loan If you have valuable assets, like a car or property, consider a secured loan. By putting up collateral, you‚Äôre giving lenders a safety net, which can help you snag better terms. It‚Äôs a trade-off, but if it helps you get the funds you need, it might be worth it. Get a Co-applicant or Guarantor Having a co-applicant or guarantor with a solid credit score can significantly better your chances. This person will act as a for the lender, which might make them more comfortable approving your application. Just make sure that they‚Äôre fully on board and understand what‚Äôs at stake. Go for a Smaller Loan Amount If your score isn‚Äôt looking great, it might be wise to ask for a smaller loan. Lenders are often more open to approving lower amounts, reducing their risk. Plus, a smaller loan can be easier to manage when it comes to repayments. Provide Additional Documents Don‚Äôt just submit the basics, but show that you‚Äôre serious. Include additional documents, like bank statements or proof of consistent income. The more information you provide, the better picture lenders have of your financial health, which can work in your favour. Highlight Your Stable Income A steady paycheck can be a game changer. If you can demonstrate that you have a reliable source of income, lenders will feel more confident in your ability to repay the loan. It‚Äôs all about showing them you‚Äôve got a solid foundation. Keep a Low Debt-to-Income Ratio Aim to maintain a low debt-to-income ratio. This shows lenders that you‚Äôre managing your existing debts well compared to your income. Keeping this ratio under 30% can help strengthen your application. Address Any Credit Inactivity If inactivity has caused y",

    "question": "What Is Fixed and Variable Salary? Meaning, Differences and Ways to Calculate Your Salary",
    "answer": "Salary Certificate Format in Word and PDF: Free Downloadable TemplateApril 8, 2025Salary Increment Letter: Free Download, Writing Format & TemplatesApril 9, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle As an employee, it‚Äôs important to understand the different components of your income statement and one of the most critical terms is ‚Äúbasic salary.‚Äù This is the foundation of your earnings, the amount you receive before any adjustments are made for taxes, bonuses, allowances, or other factors. In India, salary and pension are fundamental rights protected by the Constitution, so it‚Äôs essential to have a clear understanding of your basic salary and how it affects your overall compensation package. By taking the time to understand this concept, you can make more informed decisions about your career, negotiate better terms with your employer, and plan for a more secure financial future. What is Fixed Salary? Fixed salary is a compensation structure that many companies offer their employees. This type of pay is a guaranteed monthly salary that does not vary based on hours worked or individual performance. It includes basic pay and additional allowances like housing, childcare, or transport. While there are some advantages to this type of pay structure, there are also several disadvantages to consider. Advantages of Fixed Salary The advantages of Fixed Salary are: Consistency: Employees like the stability of knowing what their paycheck will be each month, which can lead to less financial stress and greater peace of mind. Simpler Payroll Processing: With fixed pay, calculating payroll is easier since the amount paid to employees remains the same each month. No Need to Calculate Overtime: Fixed pay doesn‚Äôt require employers to calculate overtime since employees receive the same amount regardless of hours worked. Attracting and Retaining Talent: Including allowances in the fixed pay package can help attract and retain talented employees. Disadvantages of Fixed Salary The Disadvantages of Fixed Salary are: No Incentive for Better Performance: Since the amount of pay remains the same, fixed pay doesn‚Äôt incentivize employees to perform better or work harder. Low-performing Colleagues: Employees may become unhappy when they see low-performing colleagues receiving the same pay as high-performing ones. Allowances Affecting the Bottom Line: Including allowances in the fixed pay package can affect the employer‚Äôs bottom line and profitability. How to Calculate Fixed Salary? Employed individuals need to understand that their Fixed pay forms a crucial component of their salary structure, as it serves as the basis for calculating various benefits such as PF and gratuity. Typically, companies utilize straightforward formulas to determine an employee‚Äôs Fixed salary. Annual Fixed Salary = Monthly Fixed Salary X 12 Months However, determining the Fixed wage can vary across companies and there is no fixed method to calculate Fixed salary. Generally, a reversed calculation approach is employed where a percentage of the salary and CTC (Cost to Company) is deducted to arrive at the Fixedwage. Typically, the basic pay constitutes around 40% of the gross income or approximately 50% of an individual‚Äôs CTC (Cost to the Company). Several alternative methods exist for calculating basic pay. One such straightforward formula is: Basic Salary = Gross Pay- Total Allowances or Basic Salary = Percentage of the CTC or Gross Pay Some examples to get a better idea: Let‚Äôs consider this as a salary chart of a person named Anuj. Components Amount Gross Pay ‚Çπ25,000 Basic Salary 40% of gross pay (basic salary calculation formula 1) Basic Income ‚Çπ10,000 Now let‚Äôs take this as a salary chart of an individual named Noopur. Components Amount Gross Pay ‚Çπ50,000 Basic Salary 50% of the CTC (basic salary calculation formula 2) Basic Income ‚Çπ25,000 Tax on Basic Salary Basic salary is a crucial component of an employee‚Äôs overall compensation package. It is subject to taxation and should ideally not exceed 40% of the cost to the company. While keeping a basic salary low can lead to reduced benefits and allowances, an excessively high basic salary can attract a heavier tax burden for the employee. This is why employers and employees alike must strike a balance and ensure that the basic salary is set at a reasonable level. Interestingly, the basic salary amount can vary based on the employee‚Äôs level of seniority, with junior employees typically receiving a higher basic salary compared to their ",

    "question": "ELSS vs Mutual Funds: Difference Between ELSS and Mutual Fund",
    "answer": "Understanding Bank Account Freeze & Solutions ‚Äì Jupiter MoneyJuly 5, 2023Commodity Mutual Funds: Meaning, Types, and BenefitsJuly 7, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Mutual funds are marketable securities that pool money from investors and invest in different asset classes. ELSS or Equity Linked Savings Schemes are equity mutual funds that invest a majority of the assets in equities. Both mutual funds and ELSS operate in the same way. However, there is one major difference between mutual funds and ELSS. Read our article ‚ÄúELSS vs Mutual Funds‚Äù to find out how ELSS is different from mutual funds and which one is a better choice. What Are Mutual Funds? A mutual fund is a financial instrument that pools money from investors and invests in different securities such as stocks, bonds, government securities, commodities, money market instruments and other assets. A fund manager manages a mutual fund and is responsible for investing the investor‚Äôs money in different securities based on the fund‚Äôs objective. The fund manager does thorough market research and selects the securities for the fund, and also revises the portfolio based on the market conditions. For managing the mutual fund, the fund manager charges a small fee called expense ratio which is deducted from the profits of the fund. Since mutual funds invest in a bunch of securities, it gives small investors access to diverse securities at a minimum investment. Each investor will get units of the mutual funds based on their investment. Each unit is valued equally and is calculated by dividing the total assets by the total number of units. This value is also known as net asset value (NAV). The NAV of the fund goes up when the mutual fund makes a profit, and it goes down when it makes a loss. There are several types of mutual funds in the market based on the underlying asset classes, namely, equity mutual funds, debt mutual funds, and hybrid mutual funds. Equity mutual funds invest the majority of the assets in shares of different companies. They have a very high potential to give good returns in the long term. However, they are also the riskiest category of mutual funds. Debt mutual funds invest most of their assets in debt securities such as bonds and debentures. They are the least risky category and often give predictable returns to investors in the short term. However, their returns are lower than equity funds. What Is ELSS? Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) funds are equity mutual funds that invest at least 60% of their assets in shares. Hence, they are considered a risky investment. However, they can help accumulate wealth in the long run. The primary advantage of investing in ELSS is that the investment qualifies for tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. You can claim a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakhs under Section 80C. This is the major difference between ELSS and other categories of mutual funds. ELSS funds come with a lock-in period of three years, so you can‚Äôt redeem your investment until the three-year period ends. In case you are doing a SIP (Systematic Investment Plan), each instalment is considered a separate investment and has to complete three years for you to redeem it. ELSS funds offer the dual advantages of tax saving and capital appreciation. Investors looking to save tax and invest can consider these funds. Since these funds are pure equity funds, you must be careful before investing in them. You must have a high-risk tolerance and a long-term horizon to invest in ELSS funds. Moreover, you must align your goals with the fund‚Äôs investment objective to find the best fund that will suit your requirements. Similarities Between ELSS and mutual funds Before understanding the differences between ELSS and mutual funds, let‚Äôs see the similarities between the two. Fundamentals: The concept of mutual funds and ELSS is the same. The money is pooled from investors and invested in different asset classes. The fund managers manage the portfolio of the mutual fund. This means they do market research select stocks, invest, and periodically review the portfolio. They are also striving to make higher returns in different market scenarios. When the underlying asset classes‚Äô value increases, the mutual fund makes a profit, and if it goes down, it makes a loss. Investment: You can invest in mutual funds and ELSS either through lumpsum mode or through SIPs. Expense ratio: Mutual funds and ELSS charge a small fee called expense ratio from the investors",

    "answer": "Best Government Investment Schemes to Invest In 2025May 24, 2024Open Savings Account OnlineJune 7, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Employee Pension Scheme (EPS) are two of the most important retirement schemes in India. As an employee, it is important to understand the difference between EPF and EPS, as they both offer different benefits. This article will provide an overview of the schemes to give a comprehensive understanding of their individual merits. What is EPF Scheme? The Employees‚Äô Provident Fund (EPF) is a savings scheme introduced by the Indian Government. This scheme aims to provide financial security and stability to employees after they retire or leave their jobs. Under this scheme, employers and employees contribute a certain percentage of their salary towards the fund every month. The EPF is calculated as 12% of the employee‚Äôs basic salary plus dearness allowance. The contributions made by both employer and employee are accumulated over time with interest, providing a stable retirement fund for the employee. The interest rate on EPF varies from year to year, and you can earn a regular and fixed rate of interest that is determined by the Indian Government. What is EPS Scheme? Employee Pension Scheme (EPS) is a retirement savings plan that helps pay pensions to employees who are a part of the EPFO (Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation). The scheme benefits employees when they retire, become disabled, or die while still employed. It is designed to ensure that employees have a source of income after retirement to sustain their livelihoods. The scheme also helps employers attract and retain good employees by providing additional benefits beyond their regular salary. Employers usually administer pension schemes through trust funds managed by professional investment managers who invest the funds on behalf of members. How to calculate EPS? The Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme (EPS) is a part of the overall Employee Provident Fund (EPF) system in India. Let‚Äôs consider an example to understand the calculation of EPS in your salary. Key Points to consider before calculation: 1. The EPS contribution is 8.33% of the employee‚Äôs basic salary and Dearness Allowance (DA), subject to a maximum salary cap of ‚Çπ15,000 per month. 2. If the employee‚Äôs basic salary and DA exceed ‚Çπ15,000 per month, the EPS contribution is still calculated on ‚Çπ15,000. Example Calculation: Let‚Äôs assume an employee has: Basic Salary of ‚Çπ30,000 per month & Dearness Allowance (DA) of ‚Çπ10,000 per month Total Salary (Basic + DA): ‚Çπ40,000 per month Steps to Calculate the EPS Contribution: The maximum salary for EPS contribution is capped at ‚Çπ15,000 per month by the Government of India. Now, calculate the EPS Contribution: 8.33% of ‚Çπ15,000 (capped amount): EPS Contribution = 8.33% of ‚Çπ15,000 = 0.0833 * ‚Çπ15,000 = ‚Çπ1,249.50 Since contributions are usually rounded to the nearest rupee, the EPS contribution would be ‚Çπ1,250 per month. What‚Äôs the Difference Between EPF and EPS? The Difference Between EPF and EPS is, EPF is a plan in which both the company and the employee pay a portion of the employee‚Äôs wage. EPS, on the other hand, is exclusively contributed to by an employer. While you‚Äôre likely to get confused between these two schemes and mistake them as one, you should know they are different. There are several points of differences between EPF and EPS, such as: EPF EPS Applicability Any organisation above 20 employees is applicable for EPF Applied for people who are members of EPFO (Employee Provident Fund Organisation) Employee Eligibility All employees are eligible Employees with a salary and dearness allowance of up to ‚Çπ15,000 are eligible Employee Contribution 12% of the employee‚Äôs dearness allowance and salary. No contributions to be made by the employee Employer Contribution 3.67% of the employee‚Äôs salary & Dearness Allowance 8.33% of the employee‚Äôs salary and dearness allowance Contribution Limit 12% of the salary 8.33% on a salary of up to ‚Çπ15,000 Interest Rate Every month, the fixed interest rate is calculated and reflected by the end of a financial year Not applied Withdrawal Age Can withdraw after 58, and unemployed individuals can withdraw in a continuous trial of more than two months You start receiving a pension after the age of 58 Premature Withdrawal If specific criteria are fulfilled, partial withdrawal is allowed for exceptional cases like unemployment, loan repayment, child‚Äôs education, or marriage You rece",

    "answer": "Best Personal Loan Banks & NBFCs in India 2025November 7, 2024Salary Increment Letter to Employee: How To Write, Format & TemplatesNovember 8, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle As the expenses of an average Indian household increases, the need for taking help of a financial tool also increases for a family. A personal loan can be of great use if you have the current capacity to repay it on time. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about a personal loan. What is a Personal Loan? A personal loan is an unsecured loan that allows you to borrow a fixed amount of money from a financial institution like a bank or credit union. This use can be anything that can be covered within the approved amount limit, including covering medical expenses, consolidating debt, or covering some vacation costs. Unlike secured loans, personal loans don‚Äôt require collateral. The borrower repays the loan in fixed monthly instalments over a set period, typically with a fixed interest rate, which depends on factors like credit score, income, and loan amount. How Do Personal Loans Work? A personal loan is essentially an agreement between you and a lender that gives you access to funds for a variety of needs, whether unexpected expenses or personal projects. Typically, you‚Äôd approach a commercial lender or a reliable financial source, where they evaluate your request and, if approved, provide a set amount of money with clear terms attached. These terms cover details like interest rates, potential fees, and how you‚Äôll repay the loan. Finalising the personal loan comes down to both you and the lender agreeing to these terms, making it a mutually beneficial arrangement. Types of Personal Loans Based on the reason why you want to take a personal loan there are several different types of personal loans. Below are some of the most popular categories: Home renovation loan Wedding loan Travel loan Medical loan Debt consolidation loan Higher education loan Small personal loan Used car loan Personal loans for teachers Personal loan for emergency Personal loan for women Personal loans for government employees Personal loan for salaried Festival loan Top-up personal loan Personal loans for pensioners Personal loan for self-employed Senior citizen personal loan Personal loans for students In urgent need of funds?

So, you can take up a loan without having to keep your home or vehicle as collateral. Competitive Interest Rates: You can get a personal loan with competitive interest rates, especially if you hold an excellent credit score. Minimum Documents: Personal loans are known to be disbursed quickly as they require minimal documentation. All you need to do is hold a few necessary documents that you already own, like your Aadhar card, PAN card, or passport, depending on the lending institution. Flexible Repayment Options: If you have a great credit score, you can take benefit of a flexible repayment option. With different tenures available for repayment, different repayment options are suited as per your needs. Improved Credit Score: If you manage to repay your personal loan responsibly within timely instalments, you can improve your credit score, giving you better chances of getting bigger loans with favourable terms.

    "question": "The History of Stock Market Crashes in India",
    "answer": "Cost of Living In BangaloreAugust 22, 2022Stock Market Explained for BeginnersAugust 23, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle The stock market is where people can buy and sell shares and stocks of any listed company. A share signifies part ownership of a company. The stock is the entire collection of its shares. When you buy shares of a company listed in the stock market, you can make profits when they perform well and vice versa. Moreover, you can sell them at any point. How did the stock market start? The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) are two of the stock markets in India where the country‚Äôs most trading takes place. BSE was founded in 1875 and is India‚Äôs oldest stock exchange. NSE initiated trading in 1994, but it was established two years before that. It is the largest stock market in the country in terms of volume. Stock market crashes in India In the long history of Indian stock trading, there have been a few stock market crashes affecting the shareholders financially. If you want to invest in shares, it is important to know the reasons for previous crashes in India‚Äôs stock market. It will help you get an idea about factors that might affect the market. 1. Stock market crash 1992 Harshad Mehta single-handedly caused the 1992 stock market crash, the largest in India in terms of percentage. He was a broker who planned the securities scam and manipulated the stock market, which resulted in the fall. During that period, the BSE experienced a 12.77% leap. 2. Stock market crash 2004 BSE fell by 842 points during the 2004 crash. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) investigated this incident to discover that the crash resulted from UBS carrying out a large amount of selling orders for anonymous clients. UBS was a prominent overseas institutional investor. 3. Stock market crash 2007 It is one of the worst stock market crashes in India, with long-lasting effects. SENSEX suddenly fell by 617 points on 2nd April 2007. It witnessed another fall of 615 points on 1st August 2007. It was the third-largest loss for the index in Indian history. The stock market continued to crash regularly for the rest of the year, too. 4. Stock market crash 2008 The Great Recession hit the world in 2008, the effects of which appeared as a fall of 1408 points in BSE. It affected the investors significantly and resulted in a loss of wealth. SENSEX experienced a dip of 875 points on 22nd January 2008 and another 834 points on 11th February 2008. On 24th October 2008, SENSEX fell by 1,070 points again. It was the second-largest intraday SENSEX crash. 5. Stock market crash 2015-2016 The first hit of 2015 came as an 854-point drop in SENSEX on 6th January. But it was just the beginning as the SENSEX fell by 1,624 points on 24th August 2015. At the same time, NSE also fell by more than 490 points. According to experts, this crash resulted from hasty stock selling in India and China after a slowdown in the latter‚Äôs markets. BSE experienced four consecutive falls of over 1600 points by February 2016 as the crashes continued. It occurred due to the increasing numbers of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in India‚Äôs banking industry and other global events. The country experienced another share market crash in November 2016 due to demonetization. 6. Stock market crash 2019 The year 2019 witnessed a 400-point dip in SENSEX and a NIFTY crash of 10,850 points as the US Federal Reserve dashed expectations of a long cycle of rate cuts. The crash continued in the Indian stock market due to the signs of economic slowdown and low quarterly earnings. As a result, investors in BSE lost ‚Çπ13.70 lakh crore after Budget 2019. Effects of a stock market crash When the stock market bubble bursts, it leads to a bear market, during which the investors sell off stocks and there is a 20% or higher decline in the stock market value without any improvement. Significant drops in stock prices can lead to insolvency and recession as the growth of affected companies slows down. They stop generating enough revenues, resulting in employee layoffs. Investors also suffer losses if the stock market condition does not improve quickly. What to do during and after a stock market crash? After a market crash, the first thing to do is checking your stocks. Determine which shares have been affected the most. Recheck if your portfolio includes more high-risk stocks or safe ones. Once you know your investment portfolio exposure, take the below steps to counter the ma",

When the dinar was introduced in 1960, its value was initially pegged to the British pound. Here are the main reasons for its high value: Oil Exports: Kuwait is one of the top oil exporters globally, giving its economy a strong base and supporting the value of the KWD. Fixed Exchange Rate: The KWD is pegged to a basket of currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen, which helps maintain its stability. Political Stability: Kuwait enjoys political stability, making it attractive for foreign investments and reinforcing the value of the KWD. Controlled Supply: The Central Bank of Kuwait carefully regulates the supply of KWD, contributing to its scarcity and value. Bahraini Dinar (BHD) The Bahraini Dinar, known as BHD, is the currency of Bahrain and is the second-highest currency in the world. Bahrain‚Äôs economy is heavily dependent on oil exports. Here are some reasons for its strong value: Oil Exports: As a major oil and gas exporter, Bahrain benefits from high commodity prices.

Low Inflation: Bahrain maintains a low inflation rate, contributing to the stability of the BHD. Omani Rial (OMR) The Omani Rial, or OMR, is the currency of Oman. Before 1940, Oman used the Indian Rupee. The Omani economy mainly relies on oil exports, and the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar, which helps its value. The OMR ranks as the 3rd highest currency for several reasons: Oil Exports: Oman is a significant exporter of oil and gas, both of which are highly valuable commodities. Low Inflation: Oman enjoys a relatively low inflation rate, which helps maintain the OMR‚Äôs value. Jordanian Dinar (JOD) The Jordanian Dinar, known as JOD, is the currency of Jordan and replaced the Palestinian pound in 1950. The dinar is the fourth strongest currency in the world due to these factors: Fixed Exchange Rate: The JOD is pegged to the U.S. dollar, which stabilises its value. Diversified Economy: Jordan has a more varied economy that does not rely heavily on oil exports, making it less vulnerable to global oil price changes. Gibraltar Pound (GIP) The Gibraltar Pound, or GIP, is the currency used in Gibraltar. It is pegged to the British Pound Sterling at a one-to-one exchange rate, allowing for easy conversion. The GIP ranks 6th among the world‚Äôs strongest currencies due to several reasons: Fixed Exchange Rate: Being pegged to the British Pound means the GIP benefits from the strength of the UK economy.

    "question": "What is Disbursement ‚Äì Definition, How It Works, Types, Examples",
    "answer": "Overspending ‚Äì Psychology, Meaning, Reasons, And Techniques to StopMarch 27, 2025Best Expense Tracker Apps in India ‚Äì Personal Expense Tracker AppsMarch 31, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle Businesses should understand various payment-associated processes to avoid any hassles. Non-compliance or errors may result in penalties, failed audits, and other charges. Therefore, while making payments for the business, understanding every aspect of cash flow is important. Disbursement is a cash outflow either to make a purchase or for any other transaction. It means paying the money and an actual transfer from one bank account to another. What Is Disbursement? In accounting terms, it refers to different types of payouts made during a period. These may include interest paid on loans and other operating expenses. These also comprise all types of cash payouts, cheques, electronic fund transfers, and other payouts. For businesses, such payouts are a part of their cash flows and a record of daily expenditures. If the revenues are more than such outflows, it can be an early indication of insolvency. How Disbursement Works? For bookkeeping purposes, disbursements are payouts made in cash or cash equivalents by a company during a particular period. The accountant records every transaction and posts it to the cash journal or the general ledger. The entries include the payee names, debited or credited amount, the purpose of the payout, its method, and disbursement date. The cash balance for the business is then adjusted in the account to accommodate these payouts. Such types of transactions are records for funds flowing out of the business and can be different from the actual profits or losses made by the company. If an organisation follows the accrual method of accounting, the payouts are recorded when these occur and not when paid. Similarly, revenues are recorded when these are earned and not on the actual receipt date. The types of payouts in the ledger may also vary depending on the kind of business. For example, a manufacturing company will have payouts for production expenses and raw materials. On the other hand, retailers may have payouts towards salaries, inventory, and accounts payable. Business managers use these ledgers to determine and keep track of the amounts of funds disbursed. Management can keep a record of the amount being spent on inventory when compared to other costs. Moreover, managers can keep a check on any missing or incorrectly recorded checks from the entries made to the ledger. Examples of Disbursement Knowing what is disbursed amount is important to ensure companies accurately record these transactions. Some examples of disbursals are as follows: ABC Limited writes a cheque in favour of XYZ Limited for inventories purchased on 1st April 2021. The total amount without any discount is INR 1 lakh. This amount is recorded as a credit to the cash account and debit to the inventory account. When a company pays salaries to the employees, the entry is a credit to the cash account and debit to the salary account. Company A purchased materials worth INR 50,000 from company B. While making the payment, company B gave a discount of INR 2,500; so, company A paid only INR 47,500. The entry is a credit to the cash account (INR 47,500) and inventory account (INR 2,500) and debit to accounts payable. Other examples are different types of loan disbursements, such as home loans, student loans, loans against property, and personal loans. Types of Disbursement Controlled Disbursement This type of service is offered by financial institutions to their corporate clients. It allows the companies to review and reschedule the payouts on a daily basis. Controlled payouts maximise the interest earned on the balance maintained in the account and delay the precise time when a specified amount is debited from the company‚Äôs account. Delayed Disbursement Also known as remote disbursement, here, the payout process is deliberately dragged out by issuing a cheque drawn on a bank that is located in a remote area. During the time when banks were able to process payouts only when the physical cheque was received, such delays could postpone the payer‚Äôs account from being debited by the cheque amount by up to five working days. However, the acceptance of electronic cheques has made such delays difficult. Cash Disbursement These measure the amount that actually flows out of the company and can be different from the profit or loss. There are several met",

    "answer": "How Many Mutual Funds Should I Invest In & How Much Is Too Much?December 11, 2022How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains on Debt Mutual Fund?December 13, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle A systematic Investing Plan (SIP) is a feature offered by mutual funds so that you can invest systematically over a period of time. Through SIP, you can invest a certain amount every month. This amount is directly auto-debited from your bank on a specific date chosen by you. But what happens when there is not enough balance in your account? Read to find out the consequences of missing a SIP installment and how to escape a mutual fund penalty. Consequences of missing a SIP If you don‚Äôt maintain sufficient balance in your account on the date of the SIP, you will miss an instalment. Following are the consequences of missing a SIP. Can‚Äôt fulfill goals on time: By investing a certain amount every month, you are accumulating wealth in the long term to fulfill your goals. But if you miss an installment, you are extending the target date of your goal by some time. So, every time you miss your SIP installment, you push the date further and won‚Äôt be able to fulfill your goals on time. Pay a penalty: When you set up a SIP, you authorize the Electronic Clearance Service (ECS) and National Automated Clearing House (NACH) with the bank to auto-debit a certain amount on a specific date. Every month on the day of the SIP installment, the Asset Management Company (AMC) sends a request to the bank, and the bank, on your behalf, pays the SIP installment from your account. If you don‚Äôt have enough balance, the bank rejects the request from the AMC. The AMC doesn‚Äôt charge any penalty for a missed SIP, but the bank does. YourYour bank charges a penalty in the range of Rs 250-750 for every missed SIP for not maintaining sufficient balance in the account. Cancellation of SIP: If you miss three consecutive SIP installments, then the AMC will automatically cancel your SIP. The existing investments will not be disturbed and will keep earning returns for you, but no additional investment will go through from your account. In case you want to restart the SIP, then you will have to start over the entire SIP process and set up an auto-debit again. How to avoid penalties on SIP? It is possible to avoid penalties on SIP by simply maintaining the minimum balance in your account. Make sure you maintain the required balance in your account on the date of SIP. You can set up the SIP date a day or two after you receive your paycheque, so you never miss the SIP instalment. Alternatively, you can pause the SIP if you don‚Äôt have the required balance. All AMCs and mutual fund platforms have the facility to pause your SIP. This way, the AMC will not send a request to the bank on the date of SIP, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about the penalty if you don‚Äôt have enough balance. You can restart the SIP whenever you want without any hassle. But what if you forget to restart your SIP or don‚Äôt receive your salary on time? You are missing out on your investments, and you end up paying the penalty for your missed installments. Investing is supposed to be simple and hassle-free, and not filled with penalties. Hence, we at Jupiter money introduced no penalty SIP. What is no penalty SIP? No penalty SIP is a feature introduced by Jupiter Money, where you don‚Äôt have to pay the penalty for your skipped SIPs.

    "question": "Best Time to Buy & Sell Mutual Funds in India",
    "answer": "A Complete Guide on Real Estate Mutual Funds: ‚Äì Jupiter MoneySeptember 4, 2023ULIP vs Mutual Funds: Which is a better investment?September 25, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Mutual funds are one of the most popular investment avenues that appeal to a wide range of investors. When compared to different investments such as shares, real estate, and alternative investments, mutual funds are stable, affordable, and give reasonably secure returns. Despite being a popular investment choice, many don‚Äôt know when to invest in and redeem their mutual funds. In this article, we will cover the best time to buy and sell mutual funds in India. When is the best day to invest in mutual funds? When investing in mutual funds, the time you stay invested in the market is much more important than timing the market. The sooner you start investing, the higher the returns and the greater will be the wealth you can accumulate. This means the longer you stay invested in the market, the higher your returns will be. Let‚Äôs understand this with an example if you and your sister decide to invest Rs 10,000 a month in a mutual fund until you turn 60. Your current age is 30, and your sister‚Äôs is 35. So, each of you‚Äôll turn 60, you would‚Äôve invested for 30 years, and your sister would‚Äôve invested for 25 years. If the expected return is 12%, let‚Äôs see how much each of you would‚Äôve made by the time you turn 60. Particulars You Your Sister Monthly investment Rs 10,000 Rs 10,000 Current age 30 years 35 years Investment horizon 30 years 25 years Expected return 12% 12% Total investment Rs 36,00,000 Rs 30,00,000 Investment proceeds at the age of 60 Rs 3.52 crores Rs 1.89 crores The above example shows that the longer the investment horizon, the better the returns. By investing just Rs 6 lakhs more, for a duration of 5 more years at 12% estimated returns, you have the potential to make 1.8 times the returns than your sister. Just imagine what the returns would be if you started investing from the time you were 25 years! Hence, with mutual funds, the earlier you start investing, the higher the wealth you can accumulate. Is timing the market important to invest in mutual funds? When it comes to equities, timing the market is important. This is because if you invest at the start of the bull market, you can get higher returns than when you invest in the middle or at the peak of a bull market. Since equity mutual funds predominantly invest in the equity market, having good entry and exit points is necessary. This is because, as the market hits higher highs, the NAV (net asset value) of the mutual fund will also grow, resulting in higher returns for the investors. However, not all investors have the time and knowledge to time their entry and exit into mutual funds. Hence, it is best to follow certain practices so timing the market can be avoided altogether. Below are some of them. Take the SIP route Mutual funds allow investors to invest in regular instalments through the SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) route. With SIP, you can invest a fixed amount at regular intervals such as monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, or annually in mutual funds. You can also pause, cancel, and increase the instalment amount whenever you want. The best part about investing in mutual funds through the SIP route is the low investment. You can start investing in mutual funds with an amount as low as Rs 500 through SIP. Rupee Cost Averaging SIPs best work for long-term investment horizons. This means that over a longer period of time, SIPs can help increase returns by reducing the average cost of investment. Popularly known as rupee cost averaging, it means that by investing regularly in mutual funds across different market cycles, the investor‚Äôs average cost of investing comes down, which will increase the long-term returns. So, this basically means that if you invest in mutual funds in an upmarket, the cost per unit increases as the bulls have taken charge of the market. So, for the same amount of investment, you will get lesser units as the per-unit cost has increased. However, in a market downturn, if you continue you invest, you will get a higher number of units with the same amount of investment. This is because the per-unit cost will come down as the bears have taken charge. Let‚Äôs understand this with an example. If you first invested Rs 5,000 in a mutual fund with a NAV is Rs 10, you will get 500 units. However, as the per unit price increases to Rs 20, you will get 250 units, and if ",

    "question": "Advantages & Disadvantages of Credit Card Investments ‚Äì Jupiter Money",
    "answer": "How Credit Card EMI Works?January 17, 20247 Best Zero Forex Markup Credit Cards in India 2025January 19, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle After demonetisation, the use of debit cards and credit cards has skyrocketed. According to RBI, as of August 2023 over 9.13 crore credit cards were active, which is a 17% increase from last year of about 7.8 crore active credit cards. These cards offer unparalleled convenience, allowing you to purchase anything from groceries and medicine to tickets and services. While both are widely accepted, credit cards hold the upper hand due to their rewarding nature. However, credit cards take a back seat when it comes to investing. In this article, let‚Äôs understand which investments can be made using a credit card in India and why many investments do not accept credit cards. Credit Card Investments Credit cards are considered one of the best financial inventions. They allow you to borrow money to pay your bills without any interest if paid within the grace period. On top of this, they help you save on your bills and offer rewards and cashback. Despite being a very useful financial tool, credit cards cannot be used for investments. There are very few investments that accept credit cards, but a majority of the investments don‚Äôt. You can only invest in National Pension Scheme (NPS), gold, and insurance products using credit cards. Stocks and mutual funds do not accept credit cards for investment. Why Can‚Äôt You Use Credit Cards for Mutual Funds and Stocks? There are multiple reasons why you can‚Äôt invest in mutual funds and stocks through credit cards, and the following are some of them. Regulatory restrictions: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) doesn‚Äôt allow investors to use credit cards to invest in stocks and mutual funds. Recently, SEBI allowed investments through debit cards and digital wallets. In the case of digital wallets, it is important that you load the funds through cash deposit, net banking or debit card. You cannot use the money that you loaded in your digital wallet through your credit card for investments. Credit cards are not savings: SEBI specified that only savings or deposit funds will be used for investing. Since credit cards are pre-approved loans and not savings, you cannot use them to invest in mutual funds, SIPs or stocks. Unable to trace the source: For SEBI, it is important to trace the source of funds used for investing. In the case of savings or deposits, the source can be easily traced. However, in the case of credit cards, it is difficult to trace the source of the funds. No trail of funds: A savings account has a proper paper trail which shows the deposits and withdrawals separately. In the case of credit cards, the trail of funds is unclear. The money could‚Äôve originated from personal savings, bank loans, or a debt taken from family members. Since it is difficult to track the inflow and outflow of funds, SEBI restricted the use of credit cards. Investing in NPS Using a Credit Card One investment that allows you to invest through a credit card is NPS. The National Pension Scheme (NPS) is a retirement pension scheme introduced by India‚Äôs government. The government regulates this scheme along with the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), which was exclusively set up to oversee the activities of the scheme. Under NPS, you can invest a certain amount every year from the age of 18 until 60. After the age of 60, you will receive a lump sum amount (60%) as a retirement benefit, and the rest (40%) is utilised to buy an annuity plan, which will pay a regular pension for your entire life. All Indian citizens and non-resident Indians (NRIs) can invest in NPS to secure their financial future. NPS has two types of accounts, namely Tier 1 and Tier 2. The minimum investment in a Tier 1 account is Rs 6,000 per annum, and the maximum is Rs 1.5 lakhs per annum. Tier 2 is a voluntary account and has more flexibility than Tier 1 accounts. The minimum investment in a Tier 2 account is Rs 250 per annum. Unlike a Tier 1 account, the investment in a Tier 2 account can be withdrawn anytime. You can invest in NPS through entities such as banks, which are known as Point of Presence (POP). To find POPs near you, you can visit the PFRDA website. You can visit the POPs personally or go to their website online. Fill in the NPS application form and submit all necessary documents, such as identity, address, and age proofs. After submitting the documents, you c",

    "question": "Tax on Salary: How to Calculate TDS on Salary?",
    "answer": "Understanding Collateral Meaning- Types of Collateral & ExamplesJuly 18, 2024Tax & Inflation Effect on InvestmentJuly 23, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle If you are employed, your major source of income is your salary. It is a fixed amount of money that you receive on a pre-determined date every month to compensate you for the services you provide. If your salary falls within a certain income tax slab, then it is taxable under Section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Your employer will deduct tax before crediting your salary to the bank account. This is referred to as Tax Deducted at Source or TDS. Wondering what is TDS on salary? To understand this, you need to know how it is computed, when it is deducted, and how you can reduce your tax liability. What is TDS on salary? Section 192 requires that your employer credit your salary after deducting TDS. Typically, a TDS deduction on salary takes place on an estimate of your income. This is also the reason why you are required to provide information about your income, investments, and other deductions either at the beginning of the year or when you join the organization, whichever is earlier. When is TDS deducted on salary? TDS on salary is deducted when your salary is paid. It does not happen before or after. It is not applicable when your salary is in accrual. However, if your employer chooses to pay you an advance on your salary or if they pay you your outstanding salary in one go, then that will be taxed and a TDS deduction on salary will occur. Moreover, it is important to note that TDS is only applicable on salaries above a certain limit. So, if your annual income falls below the taxable limit, then you do not need to worry about TDS on salary. What is the rate of TDS under Section 192? According to Section 192, the TDS rate is not specific. The TDS calculation on salary is based on the income tax slab and rate in the particular financial year during which your salary is credited. Moreover, TDS deduction on salary occurs only after factoring in tax exemptions, allowances and rebates, and other deductions you are eligible for. Essentially, the total tax that has to be deducted from your income for a specific financial year is divided by 12 or the number of months remaining in that year. The subsequent amount is considered as the tax at source to be deducted. Who is responsible to deduct TDS on salary under Section 192? Here are a few entities that can deduct TDS. However, as per the TDS Section 192 for salary, there must be an employer-employee relationship between the following entities and the taxpayer. Taxpayers who are individuals Association of Persons (AOP) or a Body of Individuals (BOI) A firm that runs on partnership Trusts, both charitable and others Companies that are both private and public Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) Co-operative societies Any other organization going by any name Read on to find out how your TDS on salary is calculated. How is TDS on salary calculated? Step 1 Your employer will ideally arrive at an estimate of your net taxable income and make a TDs deduction on that. To do so, the employer will deduct allowances and tax exemptions from your gross salary. Step 2 If you have any other income, in addition to your salary, and have declared that, then your employer will add that to your taxable salary. Step 3 If you have declared any tax-saving investments under Section 80C, 80D, and other sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961, then your employer will deduct those too from your income. Step 4 Finally, your employer will deduct TDS on salary depending on the tax slab in which your taxable income falls. These steps will be much clearer with an example. Let us say your basic salary is INR 8 lakhs. In addition to this, the following items are included in your salary Dearness allowance (DA) ‚Äì INR 2 lakhs House Rent Allowance (HRA) ‚Äì INR 1 lakh Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) ‚Äì INR 1 lakh Bonus ‚Äì INR 2 lakhs Your gross salary would be the sum of all these components which is INR 14 lakhs. Now, to calculate the TDS, the following steps are to be followed. Gross salary INR 14 lakhs Less: Tax-exempted HRA (assume the entire amount) INR 1 lakh Less: Tax-exempted LTA INR 1 lakh Less: Standard deduction INR 50,000 Net salary INR 11,50,000 Less: Deductions under Section 80C INR 1,50,000 Less: Deductions under Section 80D INR 50,000 Net taxable salary INR 9,50,000 So, we see that the total taxable income is INR 9,50,000.

    "question": "NPS vs PPF: A Comparision Between the Two Popular Government Schemes",
    "answer": "Public Provident Fund ‚Äì Meaning, Features, and How to Invest in PPF?June 27, 2023Portfolio Diversification: Types, Strategies, Benefits & LimitationJune 27, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle The National Pension Scheme (NPS) and Public Provident Fund (PPF) are government securities launched to encourage long-term savings for retirement. Although both offer tax benefits, the schemes are very different from each other in terms of returns, tenure, maturity benefit, and lock-in period. Read to find out the differences between these two popular government schemes. What is the National Pension Scheme (NPS)? NPS is a government-launched voluntary retirement scheme. Managed by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and Central Government, NPS offers dual benefits of investment and pension. Account opening: There are two kinds of accounts in NPS, namely, tier 1 and tier 2 accounts. Tier 1 account is a pension account with a minimum investment of Rs 500, and withdrawals are subject to certain restrictions. Tier 2 is a voluntary account with a minimum investment of Rs 250 and no withdrawal restriction. To open a tier 2 account, you must have an active tier 1 account. Documents required to open an NPS account: To open an NPS account, you require an NPS application form and KYC documents such as PAN Card, Aadhar Card, Passport, and bank account details. Returns: When you deposit money in any of the NPS accounts, it is invested in market-linked securities such as equity and debt. Hence the returns of NPS also fluctuate based on market volatility. Entry age and tenure: The minimum entry age for NPS is 18 years, and your investment matures only when you turn 60. This means your investment is locked-in until retirement. Maturity benefit: Upon retirement, 60% of the investment can be withdrawn in lumpsum, which is entirely tax-free. The rest 40% should be used to buy an annuity plan. This annuity plan will pay a pension monthly for a lifetime. If you want to withdraw prematurely, the maximum amount you can withdraw is 25% of the corpus. In case you want to opt out of the scheme, you can get a maximum of 20% of the corpus, and the rest, 80%, must be used to buy an annuity. Tax benefit: Investment in NPS up to Rs 2 lakh per annum qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C and 80CCD of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The pension you receive from the annuity plan is taxable as per your income tax slab rate when you receive it. What is the Public Provident Fund (PPF)? PPF is a small savings scheme launched in 1968 to encourage long-term savings. The following are the features of the scheme. Minimum and maximum investment: The minimum investment is Rs 500, and the maximum is Rs 1.5 lakhs per annum. To keep the account active, you must invest at least once a year. Documents required to open a PPF account: You will need to submit a duly filled and signed PPF application form, passport-size photographs, identity proof such as PAN Card, Driving License, Passport, Aadhar Card, Voter ID, address proof such as Passport, Aadhar Card, Driving License, utility bills, and nominee declaration form. Account opening: To open a PPF account, you can go to an authorized bank or a post office. You can only open an individual account. Interest: PPF pays a fixed interest of 7.1% per annum. The interest will directly get credited to your PPF account. Tenure: The tenure of the scheme is fifteen years. This means your investment will mature only after 15 years, and you will receive your investment proceeds after this tenure. Withdrawal: You can partially withdraw your PPF investment after 6th year from account opening. Loan against PPF: The scheme also gives you a loan against your PPF investment between the 3rd and 6th year. A maximum of 25% of the amount will be given as a loan for a tenure of three years. You can take a second loan before 6th year if you repay the first loan. Nomination: You can nominate a person for your PPF investment. They will receive the investment proceeds after your death. Tax benefit: The investment, interest, and maturity proceeds are all exempt from tax as PPF falls under EEE (exempt exempt exempt) category. Similarities between NPS and PPF Following are the similarities between NPS and PPF. Long-term investment: NPS and PPF are long-term investments with an investment horizon of 15 years or more. Both investments have a lock-in period until they mature. Retirement fund: The government has introduced both investments w",

Microfinance loans are small loans aimed at helping people who can‚Äôt easily get funds from regular banks. These loans are especially useful for individuals with limited income, small business owners, and those wanting to start a business. By providing financial support, microfinance loans give people a chance to earn a living, create jobs, and improve their standard of living. In this article, we‚Äôll dive into the world of microfinance loans in India. We‚Äôll cover what these loans are, who qualifies for them, the steps to apply, and the positive impact they have on individuals and their communities. Key Features of Microfinance Loans When exploring the world of microfinance, it‚Äôs important to understand what makes these loans unique and beneficial for those in need. Let‚Äôs take a look at the key features of microfinance loans below. Key Aspects of Microfinance Loans: Microfinance loans primarily serve individuals from lower-income backgrounds. Loan amounts are small, often known as microloans. The repayment terms are kept short. No collateral is required to get these loans. The main purpose is to help borrowers generate income. Types of Microfinance Loans in India Microfinance loans come in various types to meet the different needs of borrowers in India, helping boost economic growth, support self-employment, and reduce poverty. Here‚Äôs a look at some of the main types: Education Loans These loans are designed to help families cover the educational costs of their children. They can be used for expenses like tuition fees, books, uniforms, and other related costs, ensuring that children have access to education. Emergency Loans Emergency loans are offered without interest and are available year-round to help with unexpected costs, such as medical emergencies or funeral expenses. They provide quick financial support when people need it the most. Income Generation Loans These loans aim to assist people in starting or growing small businesses or microenterprises. The amount you can borrow is based on your ability to repay and the needs of your business. Individual Loans Individual loans are for borrowers who can provide collateral and a guarantor. Unlike group loans, these loans require a thorough assessment of the borrower‚Äôs business and income before they are approved. Mid-Term Loans If borrowers have successfully paid back their income-generation loans over a certain time, they may qualify for mid-term loans. These loans typically cover the remaining balance of the initial loan, and the repayment terms are agreed upon by the borrower and the microfinance institution. Agriculture Loans These loans are specifically for farmers and those involved in agricultural work. They help finance the purchase of essential supplies like seeds, fertilisers, livestock, and equipment, ultimately aiming to enhance crop quality and production. Dairy Cattle Loans Dairy cattle loans assist individuals in buying new cattle or improving their existing dairy practices. The goal is to boost income by increasing milk production and adopting better farming techniques. Consumer Product Loans These loans allow borrowers to buy essential items that improve their daily lives, such as cook stoves, mobile phones, or solar lights. This ensures access to important products that enhance quality of life.

    "question": "What is A Subsidy? Types of Subsidies, Examples, and Their Meaning Explained",
    "answer": "Foreclosure CalculatorJuly 26, 2022What Is Automated Teller Machine (ATM) And How Does It Work?July 27, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle What is a subsidy? When a government provides benefits to a business or individual, it is called a subsidy. It can be direct (such as cash transfers) or indirect (such as loans, tax breaks, etc.). The subsidy is usually provided to overcome an economic problem and increase the quality of life for its individuals. How does a subsidy work? Because a considerable portion of the population lives in poverty, the government offers certain subsidies to businesses to make sure critical goods and services are more affordable to the poor. This subsidy company accounts for a significant portion of the government‚Äôs budget. Many entities across domains, such as agriculture, education, oil, and food, are given these subsidy benefits. The subsidy expense for an entire fiscal year in India is typically in the lakhs of crores of rupees. The worldwide crude oil price is a major determinant of the government‚Äôs total subsidy expense, as India relies on imports for more than 80% of its energy needs. Gasoline and diesel prices have been deregulated and become market-linked, removing the government subsidies burden. However, kerosene and LPG (home cooking gas) continue to be subsidised by the government. Different categories of subsidies in India When a country‚Äôs economic situation is in distress, the government introduces a subsidy company. Industries face financial stress due to foreign policies and geographical disadvantages. A subsidy can help these industries do better business and provide quality goods and services. This, in turn, builds the economic situation of a nation. There are mainly three kinds of subsidies: 1. Direct subsidy A direct subsidy is a payment made by the government to a third party for which no goods or services are exchanged. As a result, money is paid, but the government gets nothing in return. Payments to both commercial firms and low-income individuals are examples of direct subsidies. This could include housing allowances, food vouchers for low-income families, or payments to private businesses as ‚Äúcash in the bank‚Äù payments. 2. Indirect subsidy Indirect subsidies assist the third party without providing a monetary advantage. For example, subsidy company loans can be considered a sort of indirect subsidy. Although it is not a monetary transfer, it does benefit certain firms. In a nutshell, direct subsidies are monetary payments made to third parties. On the other hand, indirect subsidies benefit a third party without directly giving them money. 3. Subsidies provided by the government The government offers a variety of government subsidies. Welfare payments and unemployment benefits are two of the most popular types of individual subsidies. They aim to assist citizens who are temporarily experiencing financial hardship. Other incentives, such as subsidised student loan interest rates, are provided to encourage people to continue their studies. Government subsidies are given to enterprises to help them compete against overseas competition. These rivals may have dropped their prices to the point that the domestic business would be unprofitable without the subsidy. In the past, organisations in the agriculture, banking, oil, and utility sectors have received a great bulk of government assistance to outshine their competitors. Types of Subsidies in India Here is a list of types of subsidies available in India: Food subsidy: The food subsidy benefits both consumers and producers. It is used to purchase grains from farmers at a price that makes farming profitable and then sell the grains to needy households at a lesser price or give them for free. Maintenance and other administrative costs account for a portion of the food subsidy. The federal government and the state purchase food grains for distribution through the PDS. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) purchases it for the Centre under ‚Äúcentralised procurement,‚Äù while many state agencies purchase it for their individual states under ‚Äúdecentralised procurement.‚Äù Production subsidy: By partially compensating production costs or losses, a production subsidy encourages suppliers to expand the output of a specific product. The goal of production subsidies is to increase the production of a particular product so that the market will promote it while keeping the ultimate price to consumers low. Consumption subsidy: A consumption subsidy",

    "question": "Best Investment Options in India 2023: Investment Plans for High Returns",
    "answer": "Fund of Funds in India: Interest Rates, Benefits and TaxationSeptember 29, 2022Best Tax Saving Investment Options in IndiaSeptember 29, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Significance of Investment Well-known value investor Benjamin Graham once said, ‚ÄúThe best way to measure your investing success is not by whether you‚Äôre beating the market but by whether you‚Äôve put in place a financial plan and a behavioural discipline that are likely to get you where you want to go‚Äù. Nothing can describe the concept of investing in a better way than this. However, when it comes to investing, investors are always in a dilemma as to the selection of the best investment plan. With so many investment avenues available, it is important that the investors know their investment goals before they begin. Let‚Äôs understand what are the points you should keep in mind while selecting the best investment plan, followed by some of the best investment avenues that deserve a place in your portfolio. Factors to Consider when Selecting Investment Plans Investment plans require a systematic approach. Various factors drive investment plans. Most noticeable among them are the multiple financial goals that you may have. Financial goals have timelines, and investment plans must be aligned with them. Investment plans also need to be aligned to cash outflows, such as payment of rents, utility bills, and short-term obligations due to borrowings. Best Investment Options in India Multiple factors need to be considered while you evaluate the best investment options. Investment plans are typically evaluated on return, risk, tax, and liquidity parameters. However, investment plans are not just about multiplying wealth and selecting suitable investment options but also about teaching a habit of investment. Let us understand the various aspects of investment plans in multiple contexts. Best Investment Options in India with High Returns High return is a relative term. However, returns sufficiently higher than risk-free returns can be considered high. Risk-free return is earned by investing in government securities. Below are examples of some of the best investment schemes with high returns: a) Mutual Funds, specifically those investing in mid- and small-cap: While equity mutual funds generally have high return potential, it is mid- and small-cap funds that generate a much higher return. Understanding that the high expected return of mid and small-cap funds comes with increased risk is essential. If you are investing with a time horizon of 4-5 years, then mutual funds are some of the best investment plans for 5 years. It is pertinent to note that schemes of various mutual funds comprising large-cap stocks also have the potential to generate high returns. An investor can create a good mix of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap funds to create a high potential return. b) Direct Equity Investment: Direct equity investment has been a preferred choice for generating a high return. However, this can be riskier than mutual fund investment. Selecting companies, which have the potential to generate a high return, can be challenging as it requires an understanding of various financial and non-financial parameters. However, investors can select companies based on critical parameters such as consistent profitability, significant market share in goods or services offered, management capabilities, and sound track record of corporate governance. c) Equity-linked Savings Scheme (ELSS): Mutual fund investment in ELSS comes with dual benefits. First,these plans can generate a high return and investment of up to Rs 1.5 lakhs; also, these schemes qualify for tax deduction under section 80C. However, there is a three-year lock-in, meaning money invested cannot be withdrawn for 3 years. Best Investment Options in India with a Short-term Perspective There are many plans available for short-term investment. These plans can meet investment requirements of 1 to 3 years. Some of these investment plans are as follows: Liquid Plans: These plans invest in money market instruments maturing within 90 days. Returns generated by these plans are comparable to savings accounts and range between 3% to 4%. Low-duration Funds: The low-duration funds invest in securities based on duration. Typically, they target securities with a duration of 6-12 months. These are also considered one of the best investment plans for 1 year. Recurring Deposits: These deposits can be opened for 12 to 120 months. You must deposit a ",

    "question": "Laying the foundations of a new financial system",
    "answer": "COVID-19 Insurance | Too much fine-print, too little cover?April 28, 2020Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) ‚Äì Meaning, Types, Tax BenefitsJuly 25, 2022 In a remote village somewhere in Phulera in UP, an engineering graduate turned Panchayat secretary was studying for his CAT. He decided to take a break from his studies to go get a chai. After placing the empty chai glass on the counter, he took out his mobile phone from his pocket and paid the chaiwaala. If you think we‚Äôre starting to describe the plot of the hit Amazon Prime series Panchayat, well‚Ä¶no. What we are starting to describe is the story of the holy grail of payments in India: UPI. A decade ago, a scenario like that would have provoked disbelief. Today, it‚Äôs pretty much the preferred way of paying for both consumers and merchants. The idea that it‚Äôs easier to pay for a cab in Jharkhand than in New York is quite intriguing, to say the least. So, let‚Äôs explore how we got here. Humble beginnings of a payments revolution In the summer of 2011, the average Indian was making only about six non-cash transactions per year. If you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs how many mobile payments I make in a day!‚Äù, there were several reasons why digital transactions weren‚Äôt widespread back then. On one hand, 145 million households were excluded from banking. On the other, only a fraction of retailers (10 m) accepted card payments, while options like NEFT and cheques were obviously not suited for small-ticket transactions. It was at this time that the NPCI (a non-profit entity and quasi-regulator of payments, set up by the RBI), was mulling over the establishment of a payments system that was more inclusive and comprehensive of all sections of society. They were also starting to notice the success of the IMPS (Immediate Payments Service) set up in 2010, which allowed for inter-bank transfers between any two bank accounts in real-time, through a mobile phone. Meanwhile, there were a few other developments that were setting the Indian landscape up for a revolution: The launch of Aadhar sowed the seeds of giving Indians a ‚ÄòDigital identity‚Äô. Over 1.1 Billion people were enrolled in Aadhar, which aimed to give every individual a verifiable 12-digit identification number connected to biometric data. The advent of this type of identity program meant that there was potential to start linking Aadhar to bank accounts, hence leading to more financial inclusion. There was also the Prime Minister‚Äôs Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), that gave people access to financial services such as savings and deposit accounts, remittance, credit, insurance, and pension to citizens. This led to 270 million bank accounts being opened by Feb 2017, thus bringing into the fold all those people who were excluded from the banking system. Another important development of the time was the massive increase in smartphone adoption. By 2016, India‚Äôs mobile phone subscriber base crossed the 1 billion users mark. This brings us to the key government initiative that helped accelerate payments in India, by tying all these developments together- JAM (Jan-Dhan Aadhaar Mobile). The idea of JAM was to link bank accounts, Aadhaar numbers, and mobile phone numbers. The government could use this as a ‚Äòmapper‚Äô, for various other initiatives such as providing LPG subsidy or disbursing large-scale payments (think COVID relief fund). Now we circle back to the NPCI and their conundrum: How do they create the next generation of digital payments while achieving financial inclusion along with an increasingly cashless economy. We already had a billion people with access to mobile phones, and a growing number of millions with bank accounts, what the NPCI needed was to find a point of convergence between the two. Enter UPI. UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is a secure, reliable, and mobile-first method of interoperable transfers. It uses a ‚Äò VPA‚Äô (Virtual Payment Address) that links to a global identifier (such as an Aadhar number) to let people send or receive money. Remember the objective with which JAM was launched? It pretty much helped bring UPI to life. Now all of this meant that people could make a payment transaction by exchanging the bare minimum amount of sensitive information required. In fact, it was almost like an email ID with your bank‚Äôs name and required none of the hassles that came with entering your IFS codes or adding beneficiaries when one used the good ol‚Äô NEFT transfers.

    "answer": "EPF Passbook Download ‚Äì How to Download EPF Statement?August 28, 2024How to Validate Credit CardAugust 28, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle If you are reading this article, it is time to pat your back because you have already won half the battle. Deciding to start investing is the best step forward to a financially secure future. But what is investment? In simple terms, it is the process of putting your surplus money in shares, schemes, bonds, and different financial products where it can grow over time. Keeping the money in a savings account would give you around 4% to 6% returns, depending on the bank. But the inflation rate in India varies between 6% and 7%. So, if you are only saving your money, you are practically losing it. That is why investing your money is a better option than saving. Why is it important to invest? When you invest your money, it makes your future secure and enables you to accumulate substantial wealth in the long run. It helps you achieve financial objectives and fulfill your dreams like going on a Europe trip, buying a car, or purchasing a property. You may choose a financial product depending on your goal. Moreover, you can develop investment planning skills and discipline by regularly putting money in financial instruments. Types of investments There are different types of investments to choose from based on your risk appetite and requirements. While low-risk options offer moderate returns, taking a high risk can help you earn significant profits. However, avoid putting all your money in risky options as they expose you to the possibility of huge losses. The good thing is that there are plenty of investment avenues to choose from in India. So, you can always pick the ones that are aligned with your goals. Below is a list of four popular investment products in the country. 1. Employees‚Äô Provident Fund (EPF) Employees‚Äô Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 mandates that all employers must provide this investment option to their employees. Your company puts 12% of your Basic Salary and Dearness Allowance in your EPF account on your behalf. They also contribute the same amount to your EPF. You also get an interest on the amount and receive the total accumulated fund at the time of retirement. Moreover, if you leave the company and remain unemployed for over two months, it makes you eligible to withdraw the money. How EPF Returns work: Contributions: Both the employer and employee contribute a portion of their monthly salary to the EPF account. The current contribution rate is 12% of the basic salary plus dearness allowance (DA). Interest: The accumulated amount in the EPF account earns interest at a rate declared by the government annually. The interest rate for the financial year 2023-24 was 8.15%. Maturity: Upon retirement or leaving the job, the employee can withdraw the accumulated amount along with the accrued interest. Note: The actual interest rate for PPF varies from quarter to quarter. 2. Public Provident Fund (PPF) It is a long-term investment option with a lock-in period of 15 years. The extended period allows your money to grow into significant wealth. You can also withdraw a portion of the fund after staying invested for five years in case of specific emergencies. The yearly investment limit of PPF ranges between ‚Çπ500 and ‚Çπ1.50 lakhs. Moreover, the tax benefit is one of the primary reasons that makes it a profitable investment avenue. Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 makes your entire annual contribution to this fund tax-deductible. PPFs are backed by the Central Government, making it a completely safe option. How PPF returns work: Regular Contributions: You contribute a fixed amount to your PPF account at regular intervals (usually monthly or quarterly). Interest Accrual: The accumulated amount in your PPF account earns interest at a rate declared by the government. This interest is compounded annually. Maturity: The PPF account matures after 15 years. You can extend it for blocks of five years. Note: The actual interest rate for PPF varies from quarter to quarter. You can also take a loan against your PPF balance after completing three years. 3. Fixed deposits (FDs) If you are looking for a low-risk investment option that offers moderate returns, FDs are for you. As the name suggests, the interest rate offered on these deposits remains fixed during the entire investment period. The tenure ranges from 7 days to 10 years, giving you the flexibility to decide ",

Since VAT is an indirect tax paid to the state governments, an accurate calculation for a clear and transparent procedure is important. The tax is calculated as the difference between the output and input taxes. Input tax is paid by the sellers for procuring the necessary raw materials. And output tax is paid to the seller at the time of the sale. Here is an example to understand the calculation of this indirect tax. Assume that you paid INR 5 lakhs for buying raw materials for your products and the input tax was levied at 10%. This means you paid INR 50,000 as the input tax. You sold the goods for INR 7.50 lakhs and the output tax is payable at 10% of the total income. Therefore, the output tax is INR 75,000. The VAT is the difference between the two, which comes to INR 25,000 (75,000 ‚Äì 50,000), which is payable to the government. What are the features of VAT? This tax is not voluntary, but it is an important component of the overall tax structure in the country. The features of this indirect tax are as follows: Since it is levied at various stages in the sales cycle, the possibility of any errors is reduced. Any type of tax fraud can be avoided because it is a mule-stage tax levied at each level of the cycle. It provides a transparent and uniform tax structure. Similar goods manufactured by different companies are taxed at the same rates, which increases the acceptance level among the taxpayers. With transparency, the possibility of evading tax is almost negligible. VAT registration: Online procedure Visit the official website of the National Portal of India and once you log in, click the registration tab. Fill in the relevant information and attach scanned copies of the necessary documents. The company is provided with a temporary registration number. Once the information and documents are successfully registered, the company is provided with a permanent VAT registration number.

The collection of this tax is classified under the following four categories. Account-based collection Tax is calculated based on the value addition and not on the sale value. It is determined by calculating the difference between allowable purchases and revenue. Invoice-based collection The t",

    "question": "PMS V/S Mutual Funds: Meaning, Benefits and Comparison",
    "answer": "Recurring Deposit: Features, Benefits, Eligibility & Interest RatesNovember 24, 2022Understanding Compounding in Mutual FundsDecember 8, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle There are so many tools and ways to enter the market that choosing one is difficult. Experts advise choosing the best method based on your financial goals and resources. Both portfolio management services (PMS) and mutual funds are professionally managed investments where a qualified fund manager manages the portfolio. They allow investors to get exposure to the market and help them reach their financial goals. So, what‚Äôs the difference between the two? The latter is accessible to everyone, while the former is only for investors with big money. Read to know more about the difference between PMS funds and mutual funds. What is PMS? Portfolio management service (PMS) is a wealth management service where a professional fund manager manages your portfolio. The fund manager invests your money in stocks and securities after thorough market research. They either make investing decisions independently, take your consent for every transaction, or provide advisory services and you will have to execute the transactions on your own. They provide their services for a fee, which is usually a percentage of the investment amount or a cut in profits. The fund manager also customizes the portfolio based on your financial goals, risk appetite, and investment tenure. What are Mutual Funds? Mutual funds are investments that pool money from several investors and invest in stocks and securities based on the fund‚Äôs objective. A fund manager takes all the decisions regarding the portfolio independently, and the investors have no say in it. They perform extensive market research before choosing the securities for the portfolio and charge a small fee from the investors. Mutual funds are governed by the securities and exchange board of India (SEBI) and must make daily and monthly disclosures. Several kinds of mutual funds are available in the market, and investors can choose based on their financial goals, investment tenure and risk appetite. Benefits of PMS Professional management: In PMS, an experienced fund manager handles your portfolio. They understand how to handle a portfolio in different market conditions and manage your investments efficiently to increase returns over time. Customized portfolio: Fund managers customize the portfolio according to your goals, risk tolerance levels, investment horizon, and age. They will factor in all these before choosing securities for your portfolio. Transparency: As an investor in a PMS fund, you can get complete information about all transactions. You can also know the status of the portfolio and its holdings anytime you want and not wait for monthly, quarterly, or half-yearly updates from the fund house. Regular monitoring: The fund manager will monitor your portfolio closely and monitor its performance. If they find any deviation, then they will alter the portfolio immediately. Benefits of Mutual Funds Low minimum investment: You can start investing in mutual funds with just Rs 500. You don‚Äôt need a huge amount to invest in them. Multiple modes of investment: You can invest in mutual funds either in lumpsum or regularly through a systematic investment plan (SIP). Based on your requirements, you can choose one of the two options. Transparency: The fund house is required to release the net asset value (NAV), expense ratio, portfolio holdings, and any other disclosures regularly. This ensures transparency in your investments. Diversification: You can access an entire basket of stocks and securities by investing in one mutual fund. This ensures your portfolio is well diversified across multiple securities. Professional management: Mutual funds are managed by professionals. They are well experienced and experts in their fields who know how to handle a portfolio in different market situations. Differences between PMS Funds & Mutual Fund Following are the major differences between PMS funds and mutual funds. Investment amount The minimum investment amount in a mutual fund is Rs 500 through SIP, whereas for PMS, the minimum ticket size is Rs 50 lakhs. Hence mutual funds are easily accessible to all investors, unlike PMS funds. Fees Mutual funds charge a fixed expense from their investors, which is directly cut from the fund‚Äôs NAV. Investors are not liable to pay any taxes on individual transactions. In contrast, PMS charges a fixed fee or a p",

    "question": "Medical Allowance in Salary: Everything You Need to Know",
    "answer": "Liquid Funds vs FD: Which is Better?July 27, 2023Leave Travel Allowance in Salary: Claim Rule, Eligibility, Tax ExemptionsJuly 28, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Are you curious about medical allowance in salary? Well, you‚Äôve come to the right place. In this article, we‚Äôre going to delve into the world of medical benefits and their tax implications. We‚Äôll explore what medical allowances are, how they work, and why they matter. So whether you‚Äôre an employee wondering about the perks of having medical allowances or an employer trying to navigate the intricacies of offering such benefits, sit back and get ready for a crash course on understanding the ins and outs of medical allowances in salary! What is Medical Allowance in Salary? Medical allowance refers to a fixed allowance paid to employees by their companies on a monthly basis, regardless of whether they submit bills to substantiate their medical expenses or not. On the other hand, medical reimbursement involves reimbursements made to employees against specific medical bills they submit, subject to entitlement. In order to benefit from tax incentives, employees must submit monthly bills for medical reimbursement equivalent to the incurred expenses. Under the Income Tax Act, medical allowance is not classified as an allowance that qualifies for exemption. As a result, medical allowance is fully taxable. However, employees can claim a tax benefit of up to Rs. 15,000 under medical reimbursement by providing valid bills or supporting documents. What Is the Difference Between Medical Allowance and Medical Reimbursement? Medical allowance and medical reimbursement are terms often used interchangeably, but they actually have different implications for tax purposes under the Income Tax Act of 1961. Experts recommend referring to the medical component of an employee‚Äôs salary as ‚Äúmedical reimbursement‚Äù rather than ‚Äúmedical allowance‚Äù because the latter is usually taxable unless there are specific exemptions. Under the Income Tax Act, medical reimbursement falls under Section 80D, and the maximum amount allowed per year is Rs. 15,000. It‚Äôs crucial for employees to timely submit their medical reimbursement bills, as failure to do so may result in 30% of the Rs. 15,000 becoming taxable. However, employees can claim back 30% of the deducted amount when they file their tax returns. To ensure compliance, auditors and officials from the IT department closely examine medical reimbursements. Employers are responsible for making these reimbursements to employees once valid bills are provided to claim the tax-exempt status. Notably, failure to deduct taxes on amounts without submitted invoices may lead to penalties related to Tax Deducted at Source (TDS). Types of Medical Allowances Depending on the company policy and nature, medical allowances fall into 3 categories: Fixed Medical Allowance, Mediclaim Policy and Medical Reimbursement. Let‚Äôs learn them in detail: Fixed Medical Allowance: This refers to a fixed amount paid by employers to employees as part of their salary. Irrespective of whether this amount is spent on medical costs or not, it is taxable. For example, if an individual‚Äôs salary includes a medical allowance of Rs. 5,000, they will be taxed if their total income falls under the taxable income bracket for that financial year. Mediclaim Policy: Health Insurance: Employers often provide a mediclaim policy exclusively for the employee. Employers can claim this amount in their corporate return. Medical Reimbursement: In this case, employees are required to submit medical bills, including the cost of medicines, to their employers. Employers then reimburse the claims after verifying the bills on an actual basis. Latest Update on Medical Reimbursement In the budget for the financial year 2018-19, the Finance Ministry of India reintroduced the standard deduction under the Income Tax Act, eliminating the medical reimbursement of Rs. 15,000 and travel allowance of Rs. 19,200. However, the medical allowance now falls under the standard deduction, which was raised from an initial Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 50,000 per year, effective in 2019. The standard deduction refers to a flat deduction from the gross salary that is not subject to tax. It can be used to lower taxable income and reduce the total tax liability. Salaried individuals and pensioners can benefit from this deduction. It is important to note that taxpayers following the new tax regime cannot claim the standard deduction under Secti",

    "question": "What are Credit Card Cash Withdrawal Charges?",
    "answer": "How To Get a Credit Card Without Income Proof?November 28, 2023What Is Unbilled Amount in Credit Card & Why Should You Track Them?December 15, 2023 Indian rupees withdrawn from the ATM, Financial and economic concept related to inflation and rising cost of living, Declining value of money Table of Contents Toggle Credit cards are an innovative financial instrument through which you can transact now and pay later. They also offer rewards and cashback upon spending a milestone amount. While credit cards were traditionally used for transactions, they can now be used to withdraw cash from an ATM, just like debit cards. However, there are a few charges that you must pay to use this feature. In this article, we have covered credit card cash withdrawal charges in detail. What are Credit Card Cash Withdrawal Charges? Credit card cash withdrawal, also known as credit card advance, is a feature of credit cards that allows you to withdraw cash using your credit cards at a bank‚Äôs ATM. Since credit cards are primarily used as a means of payment, cash withdrawal is an additional feature provided by credit card issuers. Not all credit cards come with this feature. But for the ones that do, charge additional charges and have certain cash withdrawal limits. How to Withdraw Cash Using Credit Card? Here‚Äôs how to withdraw cash using a credit card in India: Locate an ATM: You can use any ATM, regardless of the bank that issued your credit card. Insert your credit card: Insert your credit card into the ATM machine. Select Cash Withdrawal: Choose the ‚ÄúCash Withdrawal‚Äù or ‚ÄúCash Advance‚Äù option on the ATM screen. Enter Amount: Key in the desired amount you want to withdraw. Remember, there‚Äôs usually a limit on cash withdrawals, typically a percentage of your credit limit. Enter PIN: Input your credit card PIN. Collect Cash: Once the transaction is verified, the ATM will dispense the cash. Collect Card: Retrieve your credit card from the ATM. Types of Credit Card Cash Withdrawal Charges Banks and credit card issuers charge various kinds of fees when you withdraw cash from the ATM using your credit card. Following are the different types of charges associated with credit card cash withdrawals in India: Cash advance fee: It is the fee charged every time you withdraw money from the ATM. The cash advance fee ranges between 2.5% and 3% of the transaction amount, subject to a minimum withdrawal limit of Rs 250 ‚Äì Rs 500. The fee is reflected in the bill that you will receive at the end of the billing cycle. Finance charges: Just like how regular credit card transactions attract finance charges, cash withdrawals also have a finance charge. The finance charge is included in the cash advance fee, and it has no interest-free period. So, finance charges are applicable right from the time you withdraw cash to the day you repay it back. If you withdraw multiple times a day, the finance charge is levied on each transaction based on the cash you withdraw. Interest: Banks also charge interest apart from cash advance fees. This interest usually ranges between 2.5% to 3.5% per month on all cash advances. Interest is charged from the day you withdraw cash till the day you repay it. The interest rates are subject to change at the discretion of the bank. This is because the interest rate is decided based on your card usage, spending frequency, and repayment behaviour. ATM fee: Banks usually allow you to withdraw cash from other banks‚Äô ATMs only for a maximum of five times a month. In case you withdraw cash more than five times a month from a different bank‚Äôs ATM, each transaction will attract an ATM fee. The ATM fee is Rs 17 per withdrawal, and for non-cash transactions, it is Rs 5 ‚Äì Rs 6. The charges or fees will be reflected in your credit card statement that you will receive at the end of the billing cycle. Late payment fee: If you do not repay the full amount before the due date, the banks will charge a late payment fee of 15%-30% per annum.

    "answer": "National Savings Certificate (NSC) ‚Äì What is It? How to Purchase?August 28, 2024EPF Passbook Download ‚Äì How to Download EPF Statement?August 28, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Digital banking is done online via digital platforms, and it eliminates paperwork. Various banking services, such as moving cash deposits, account management, bill payments, fund transfers and withdrawals, investments, and loan applications and management are digitalized. What is digital banking? Today, most customers have smartphones and other gadgets, giving them easy access to online services. Digital banking is the process of digitalization of banking activities and services that were previously available only in the branches. It substitutes a traditional bank‚Äôs branch network with an online presence, making it more convenient for users to execute transactions. History of digital banking The history of these banks dates to 1993 when Temenos AG banking software system provider was founded. In 1994, Microsoft Money made bank accounts accessible for regular households. During 1997 and 1998, digital-only banks were launched in Canada and the United States of America (USA). Digital banking vs. Neo banking Do you know what is digital banking and neo banking? Often, there is confusion between the two because of their similarities. Both digital and neo banks allow you to deposit, withdraw, transfer, and borrow funds, and perform other banking transactions. However, the basic difference between a neo bank and a digital bank is their presence. Neo banks are independent entities without any association with a traditional bank and have a complete online presence only. On the other hand, digital banks are generally backed by financial institutions and offer banking services and products via online banking and mobile applications. Difference between traditional and digital banking Traditional banks Digital banks Presence Physical presence via branch network Online presence Transaction time Time-consuming as customers need to visit the branch Quick and easy Accessibility Transactions can be done only during bank working hours Transactions can be done anytime and anywhere at customers‚Äô convenience Costs Higher overhead costs due to branch network Reduced overheads as there are no physical branches Features of digital banking Digital banking in India offers several features and benefits. Some of the key aspects are as follows: Online banking You may avail of banking services from any place at any time at your convenience. With high-quality and advanced technological solutions, you can enjoy a fast and simple banking experience. Moreover, most online platforms offer similar services at no additional charges. Personal finance planning The banking sector is highly competitive, and every bank tries to offer unique solutions to gain an advantage over its competitors.

Mobile banking You may execute all financial transactions via your bank‚Äôs mobile application using a smartphone or tablet on the go. You may access your bank services and products 24 hours a day, seven days a week, making it easy to do banking at your convenience. Unified Payments Interface (UPI) Traditionally, if you wanted to pay someone, you would either issue a check or visit the nearest branch. You had to fill out the deposit slip and wait in a queue, making it inconvenient and a time-consuming process. But now, you can make digital payments to anyone at any time via UPI, which is a real-time payment mechanism developed by the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI). Funds can be transferred via virtual payment address (VPA), mobile number, bank account number and IFSC, QR code, or Aadhar number. Some of the popular UPI apps are Google Pay, PhonePe, and BHIM. Digital wallet Digital wallets are also known as virtual wallets and allow you to pay money via your smartphone. With these virtual wallets, you no longer need to carry cash while traveling or when you go shopping. Post-demonetization, millions of people started using online wallets like JioMoney, Paytm, and MobiKwik for payments.

    "question": "What is CIBIL Score? All You Need to Know about CIBIL Score",
    "answer": "Best Ways to Invest in Digital Gold OnlineJuly 29, 202410 Different Types of Credit Card Charges And FeesJuly 29, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle The Credit Information Bureau India Limited (CIBIL) is a well-known credit bureau used by most lenders to check someone‚Äôs credit score in the country. The credit score is a parameter that helps them determine if you are eligible to get a loan. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has made checking the CIBIL score mandatory for all lenders. You can find the score in your CIBIL report, which is a document that details your credit history. Now that you know the CIBIL score meaning, read on to understand how it can help you get a loan and how to improve it. Importance of CIBIL score The CIBIL or credit score is essential for every borrower. If you need a loan, the lenders will only approve the application when you have a high credit score. When you have a good score, it allows you to negotiate a more affordable loan. However, if the score is low, you can take specific steps to improve it before applying for a loan. How to check your credit score If you are wondering how to check CIBIL score, follow the eight steps given below: Visit the official website of CIBIL. Click ‚ÄòGet your CIBIL Score.‚Äô Select ‚ÄòClick here.‚Äô Provide your name, contact information, photo ID proof, date of birth, and password. Select ‚ÄòAccept and continue.‚Äô Enter the OTP received on your phone and click ‚ÄòContinue.‚Äô Click ‚ÄòGo to dashboard‚Äô and you will be redirected to myscore.cibil.com. Select ‚ÄòMember Login‚Äô to check your score. What is a good CIBIL score? The CIBIL score ranges between 300 and 900. A score between 300 and 599 is not ideal, and it will probably make the lenders reject your loan application. A score between 600 and 749 is not great, but the lenders might still consider your application if you earn a good salary. The lenders prefer a credit score between 750 and 900. With a score that high, you can confidently approach creditors as they will undoubtedly consider your application as favorable. You may even get quick loan approvals and low interest rates. The benefits of having a high CIBIL score A high credit score does not only help you get loan approvals but also offers other advantages as follows: A high credit score gets you the most competitive interest rates. It enables you to get pre-approved loans. A good CIBIL score helps you get a credit card with great rewards and benefits. It encourages the lenders to approve your loan application quickly. A good credit score means you may get a longer repayment tenure. It empowers you to negotiate with the lenders to get a better deal. Higher the credit score, higher will be your credit card limit. How is the CIBIL score calculated? Before you learn how to improve your credit score, it is necessary to understand how it is calculated. It comprises four factors, credit history, credit utilization, credit mix and duration, and miscellaneous. Credit historyThis makes 30% of your credit score. The credit history is the last three years‚Äô monthly repayment record of your equated monthly installments (EMIs), student loan, car loan, home loan, and others. If you pay all your dues in time, your credit history will be favorable. Credit utilizationThis counts for 25% of the score. This is a measurement of how much credit you are regularly using. If you have a credit card with a limit of ‚Çπ1 lakh and are using the entire amount every month, that is never a good sign. The lenders might count you as a big spender and doubt your ability to repay the loan in time. Credit mix and durationThis makes 25% of your credit score. Your credit history is made of two types of loans, secured and unsecured. A home loan is a secured loan, and a credit card or personal loan is an unsecured loan. The lenders prefer someone who has a balance of both these types of finance. If you had availed of any of them for a long duration and are paying the dues in time, it enhances your track record. MiscellaneousThis counts for the remaining 20% of the score. It includes multiple factors such as hard inquiry. If you keep applying for too many loans, the lenders check your credit score repeatedly. This is known as a hard inquiry, which can lead to rejection. Lenders do not prefer customers with too many loans. How to know the reasons for a low CIBIL score Make it a habit to check your CIBIL report frequently by visiting their official website. You can get the report for free once a year. The report sh",

    "question": "What Is Over Limit in Credit Card?",
    "answer": "What Happens if I Don‚Äôt Use My Credit Card?September 3, 2024Personal Loans vs Credit Cards: Which is Better?September 3, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Credit cards have become a key part of managing finances in India, offering perks like interest-free periods, cashback, and rewards. Their convenience makes them a go-to for both daily purchases and bigger expenses. But, while they come with many benefits, it‚Äôs essential to be aware of the terms and conditions, including the credit limit and over-limit fees. One important aspect to understand is the over-limit facility. This allows you to spend beyond your approved credit limit, but it often comes with extra costs and penalties. By knowing how over-limit charges are calculated, what they‚Äôll cost you, and how they could impact your finances, you can use your credit card more wisely and avoid unnecessary fees. What is Over Limit in Credit Card? The over-limit facility on credit cards lets select cardholders go beyond their approved credit limit, usually by 10% to 20%, depending on the bank‚Äôs rules. For example, if your limit is ‚Çπ50,000, you might be able to spend up to ‚Çπ60,000 with this feature. This extra spending power is typically extended to clients who have a good track record with their credit card use and repayment behaviour. It can be a lifesaver during emergencies or high-expense times like weddings or festivals. However, using the over-limit facility comes with additional costs. Charges typically range from 2.5% to 5% of the amount you exceed. So, if your limit is ‚Çπ80,000 and you make a purchase of ‚Çπ95,000, you‚Äôll incur a fee on the ‚Çπ15,000 excess. Remember, the amount you go over your limit isn‚Äôt interest-free‚Äîthe usual interest rates will apply. While some banks may offer waivers for small amounts over the limit or provide lower fees for premium credit cards, it‚Äôs wise to check with your bank for their specific terms. How Does Credit Card Over-Limit Work? Using this facility is a choice you make as a cardholder. When you go beyond your credit limit, you‚Äôll need to give explicit consent to your bank to allow this extra usage. Banks often approve these over-limit transactions as a helpful gesture, but they expect this option to be used sparingly and only in truly exceptional situations. There isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all rule for the over-limit facility; it varies from bank to bank. Typically, you can exceed your limit only by a reasonable amount, and you must agree to the bank‚Äôs specific terms and conditions beforehand. If you choose to use this facility, keep in mind that additional charges and interest on the excess amount may apply. Who is Eligible for Credit Card Over-Limit Facility? To qualify for the credit card over-limit facility, you generally need to be a responsible cardholder with a solid track record. This means paying your bills on time, keeping your credit usage in check, and maintaining a healthy credit history. If you consistently meet these criteria, you‚Äôre more likely to be eligible for the over-limit facility. On the other hand, if your credit score is less than stellar or you‚Äôve had a history of missed payments, banks might be hesitant to offer you this option. Essentially, a positive credit profile increases your chances of being approved for the over-limit feature. What is the Penalty for Exceeding Credit Limit? Exceeding your credit limit can lead to a few unwelcome consequences. Most credit card issuers impose an over-limit fee, which might be a percentage of the excess amount or a fixed sum, such as ‚Çπ500, plus GST. On top of this, you could face higher interest rates on the over-limit portion, making the extra spending even costlier. Repeatedly going over your limit can also harm your credit score, as high credit utilisation is a key factor in evaluating creditworthiness. Always review your credit card‚Äôs terms to understand the specific penalties that apply. Does Taking Credit Card Over-Limit Facility Impact Your Credit Score? Using this facility itself doesn‚Äôt directly impact your credit score since these transactions aren‚Äôt reported to credit bureaus. However, habitually exceeding your credit limit can have an indirect effect. Each time you go over your limit, it raises your credit utilisation ratio, which ideally should stay around 30%. Regularly pushing past your limit can signal financial instability, leading to a higher credit utilisation ratio that might harm your credit score over time. How to Avoid Over-Limit Charges Here are so",

    "question": "Renting vs. Buying a House: Which is Better?",
    "answer": "mAadhaar App ‚Äì What is it? Features, Limitations and Functionality of the AppAugust 9, 2024How to Track the PAN Card Application Status ‚Äì Multiple Easy WaysAugust 13, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Buying a house is the ultimate dream of most people in India, but does it really make more financial sense than renting a property? Well, the answer depends on multiple factors and personal choices. This article focuses on various aspects of buying vs. renting a home. If you are confused between both options, read on to make the right decision. Difference between renting and buying The fundamental difference between buying and renting a house is ownership. When you buy a property, you own it, and that does not happen when you rent one. But this is not the only thing to consider. Here are three important factors that can help determine your decision. 1. Rent ratio It is the ratio of the price of the property to its yearly rent. If the property‚Äôs worth is 20x the annual rent, it is advisable to buy it. Suppose you pay a monthly rent of ‚Çπ25,000 for a house, it amounts to ‚Çπ3 lakhs per year. If you live in that house for 20 years, it will cost you ‚Çπ60 lakhs in total. If the property‚Äôs price is less than ‚Çπ60 lakhs, the rent ratio is favorable for purchasing the property instead of renting. But, if the price of the house is over ‚Çπ60 lakhs, renting it makes more sense. 2. Rental yield It is the measure of cash your house can generate every year as a percentage of the property value. Suppose you have bought a house for ‚Çπ75 lakhs and rented it out for ‚Çπ20,000 a month. So, the property is currently generating ‚Çπ2.4 lakhs per year, which is 3.2% of its actual value. If you consider the property tax and maintenance expenses you have to bear every year, the rental yield can turn out to be less than 3%. Experts suggest that buying a house makes sense only if the rental yield is over 5%. Practically speaking, that is a distant dream in today‚Äôs scenario, especially in metro cities where the rental yield is around 2% to 3%. 3. EMI value If you take a loan to buy a property, you must consider the repayment expenses while determining whether the property will be profitable for you. A rule of thumb is, if the equated monthly installment (EMI) is more than 30% of your monthly income, it is not advisable to purchase the property and vice versa. Advantages of renting a house 1. Reduced responsibilities Living in a rental property entails lesser responsibilities and costs. You only need to pay the rent and unincluded utilities for a rented property while the owner pays for the taxes, repair costs, and maintenance expenses. 2. Low upfront costs Buying a property comes with many upfront expenses that may put a dent in your budget. On the other hand, if you rent a house, you may have to pay a security deposit and a few months‚Äô rent in advance. So, it will be more affordable to rent the property than to buy one. 3. Easy to relocate It is easy to leave a rented house as it is by definition a short-term arrangement. So, if you need to change cities, you may easily leave the old house and find another one in the new city you move to. Disadvantages of renting a house 1. You have no control When you rent a property, almost all the power belongs to its owner. They can periodically increase the rent and even make it unavailable for renting at any time. These uncertainties make renting a property a risky option. 2. You can never make it your own You cannot make changes to the rented house in most cases. Some owners do not even let you hang a painting and modifying without their permission may result in the loss of the security deposit. Advantages of buying a house 1. Security When it comes to renting vs. buying a house, the one aspect that gives a significant advantage to buying is security. When you buy a property, you own it and have the right to decide how long you want to stay there. Moreover, you can freely make modifications as per your needs and even sell it whenever you want. 2. It is an investment A house is an asset that increases in value over time. So, you can treat buying a property as an investment. It gives you the freedom to sell the house and make a profit. You can even rent it to generate regular income. Disadvantages of buying a house 1. Huge responsibility Owning a house comes with a lot of responsibilities and added expenses. You have to pay for maintenance, property tax, utilities, and much more out of your pocket. 2. Difficult to move out",

    "question": "5 Easy And Different Ways To Invest In Mutual Funds Online",
    "answer": "How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains on Debt Mutual Fund?December 13, 2022Terms and Conditions ‚Äì Big Bang Days! (‚ÄúCampaign‚Äù)December 19, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Mutual funds were unknown to investors a few decades ago. But today, they are quite popular among investors. At the end of March 2022, mutual funds are managing close to Rs 38 lakh crores worth of funds with nearly 5.2 crore SIP accounts. Despite this, many investors get confused about the process of investing in mutual funds. We explain the best and easiest ways to invest in mutual funds to eliminate this confusion. Different ways of investing in mutual funds online You can invest in mutual funds through online and offline methods. But with increased digitization and convenience, the online method is one of the easiest ways to invest in mutual funds. Following are some of the best ways to buy mutual funds online: Investment apps like Jupiter Money, Kite, Groww, Upstoxx etc. Asset Management Company (AMC) website AMC registrar Demat account Independent portals Mutual Fund Investment Apps There are multiple investment apps available in the Indian market which you can use to invest in the mutual funds of your choice.Apps like Jupiter money lets you invest in direct mutual funds without any fees. One of the best feature of Jupiter money is that even if you miss any SIPs (Systematic Investment Plan) amount due to low balance in your account, you won‚Äôt be charged any penalty for it. But, this is not true for other banks which charge heavily if you miss any SIPs due to low balance in your account. This penalty amount can range from Rs. 250 to Rs. 750 levied by other banks, whereas, in Jupiter, there are no charges associated with it. These incredible features are available to the Jupiter account users only. Best thing about Jupiter is you can easily create an account in 3-minutes. To know more about it, check the Jupiter‚Äôs offer for mutual funds here : https://jupiter.money/mutual-funds/ Asset Management Company (AMC) website To invest in mutual funds through an AMC, you have to visit their website, and by following simple steps, you can start investing in mutual funds. You will have to provide KYC (know your customer) documents online, and upon verification, you can become a mutual fund investor. You can avoid paying additional fees, such as distributor commission, by investing directly through the AMC. This will reduce your overall expenses and can lead to higher returns than regular plans in the long term. However, this method of investing is not convenient. You don‚Äôt invest in different funds of the same fund house. Hence managing and monitoring your mutual fund investments can get slightly difficult. AMC registrar Mutual fund registrars are organizations that keep track of all activities done by investors of an AMC. They offer customized statements to investors showing the transaction history and the current value of the investments. There are two main registrar transfer agents in India: CAMS and Karvy. Both have websites and mobile applications that give investors and mutual fund companies the required information. Apart from this, they also allow investors to invest in mutual funds. To invest in mutual funds with registrars, you must create an account with them and become KYC compliant. Then you can start investing in mutual funds offered by them. Both Karvy and CAMS have different AMCs registered under them, and you can only invest in funds of these AMCs. Investing in mutual funds using registrars can be easy and convenient. Apart from providing a platform to invest, they also help track mutual fund transactions and provide data about the fund‚Äôs performance. Demat account If you have a demat account for stocks, you can also use it to buy mutual funds. Many brokers provide mutual funds, and you can invest in them easily with a click of a button. If your demat account doesn‚Äôt have access to mutual funds, you can contact your broker to activate the same. Investing in mutual funds through a demat account allows you to track all your shares and mutual funds in one place. Additionally, brokers also provide research insights that will help you choose a fund for investment. But, investing through a demat account can be costly. You will incur transaction charges for every transaction and regular maintenance charges. Moreover, if you don‚Äôt have a demat account, you will also incur account opening charges.

    "question": "Structure of Mutual Funds in India (With an Example)",
    "answer": "11 Best Savings Schemes for Women to Become Financially IndependentOctober 25, 2023Why Did My Credit Card Application Get Declined? Solutions ExplainedNovember 2, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle In India, mutual funds have a three-tier structure comprising a sponsor, trustee and asset management company (AMC). These three tiers are supported by other participants such as custodian, registrar and transfer agent, fund accountant, broker, dealer, and intermediary. The structure of mutual funds is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Mutual Funds Regulations, 1996. Hence, all the participants and entities involved in mutual funds are bound to follow the rules set by the SEBI. Structure of Mutual Funds in India As mentioned earlier, the structure of mutual funds has three tiers. Below are the functions of these three tiers of a mutual fund. Source: https://www.bseindia.com/downloads1/PPT8_IntroductiontoMutualFundsInvesting.pdf Tier 1: Sponsor The sponsor forms the first layer in the structure of a mutual fund. A sponsor can be an individual or an entity whose primary objective is to earn money through fund management. The sponsor can execute the fund management through another associate company. Moreover, the sponsor can be a promoter of the associate company. To become a sponsor of a mutual fund, a person or an entity must approach SEBI and seek its permission to set up a mutual fund. Once SEBI agrees to this, the sponsor must form a public trust under the Indian Trust Act 1882 and must register it with SEBI. Once the trust is registered, the sponsor can appoint a board of trustees (BOT) who will be responsible for adhering to the SEBI Mutual Funds Regulations and protecting the unit holder‚Äôs interests. Once the trustees are appointed, the sponsor can create an AMC under the Companies Act 1956. To become a sponsor, there is an eligibility criterion that must be fulfilled. The sponsor should have a minimum of five years of experience in the financial services industry. The net worth of the business must be positive in the last five years. The sponsor‚Äôs net worth must be higher than the capital contribution of the AMC. The business should have earned a profit in the last three out of five years, including the preceding year. The sponsor should be of sound mind and physically fit. The sponsor must contribute at least 40% of the net worth of the AMC. Existing or new mutual fund sponsors should not be convicted of any offence. From the above eligibility criteria, it isn‚Äôt wrong to conclude that the sponsor‚Äôs role is vital for a mutual fund. Hence, sponsors should have high credibility and enough liquidity and must be faithful to return investors‚Äô money in case of a financial collapse. Tier 2: Trust and Trustees The second layer of the mutual fund structure is the trust and trustees. The fund sponsor employs the trustees to protect and safeguard the investors. The trust is created through a trust deed, and the trust is registered under the Companies Act, 1956. The trustees are governed by the India Trust Act 1882. Trustees do not directly manage the securities and mutual funds. Instead, they oversee the entire fund management and ensure that the regulations are being followed by the AMCs. A mutual fund house has at least four trustees, and the following are their duties. Trustees should check the work of AMC, including the back office system, dealing room, and accounting work, before the launch of a scheme. They must ensure that AMCs have not given any undue advantage to an associate, which is not in the best interest of the unit holders. Ensure the AMC performs its transactions as per the SEBI‚Äôs regulations. Take remedial steps in case the AMC doesn‚Äôt follow laws and regulations. Must review all transactions of the trust and AMC every quarter and report them to SEBI. Check customer‚Äôs complaints and how they are handled by the AMC. The trustee must submit a report with the details of the activities of the trust and the trustee‚Äôs certificate that they are satisfied with the AMC‚Äôs work to the board on a half-yearly basis. Must oversee and approve AMC‚Äôs request of floating a new fund, provided all the regulations are met. From the above, it is clear that a trustee must act independently and ensure the investor‚Äôs trust and interests are maintained at all times. Tier 3: Asset Management Company The final tier of the mutual fund structure has asset management companies. They float mutual funds with different ",

A salary account is a type of bank account where your salary is directly deposited by your employer. Typically, companies set up these accounts in bulk with a bank, allowing employees to receive their salaries on a specific date.

    "question": "NSC vs PPF ‚Äì Which is One is Better For You? ‚Äì Jupiter Money",
    "answer": "Difference Between REIT and InvIT? Meaning and Types in DetailOctober 5, 2023Solvency Ratios: Types, Meaning, Formula and CalculationsOctober 19, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle The majority of us prefer risk-free investments with guaranteed returns and have some kind of tax benefits attached to them to fulfil our financial goals. Among various investments that offer these benefits, two of them stand out. They are the National Savings Certificate (NSC) and the Public Provident Fund (PPF). Both are small savings schemes that help in fulfilling different financial goals. Read on to find out how these two stand against each other and which is a more suitable investment for you. What is NSC or National Savings Certificate? The National Saving Certificate (NSC) is a small savings scheme introduced by the government of India in 1989. The primary purpose of the scheme is to encourage savings among small and middle-income citizens. NSC pays a fixed interest at the time of maturity, but it is compounded annually. The scheme is regulated by the Ministry of Finance, which announces the interest rate every quarter. For the July ‚Äì September 2023 quarter, the interest rate of the scheme is 7.7% per annum. You can invest in NSC through any post office or an authorized bank. If you are looking for an investment to save on tax and earn guaranteed returns for a tenure of five years, then NSC is your go-to investment. Following are the features of NSC Minimum and maximum investment: The minimum investment in NSC is Rs 1,000, and there is no limit on the maximum investment. Number of accounts: You can open multiple NSC accounts in your name. Tenure: The tenure of the NSC is five years, and it cannot be extended after that. Interest payment: A fixed interest is compounded annually and is paid directly at the time of maturity. Lock-in period: The scheme has a lock-in period of five years. Eligibility: Only Indian citizens who are residents are allowed to invest in NSC. NRI (non-resident Indians), HUFs (Hindu Undivided Families) and trusts are not eligible to invest. Documents required: To open an NSC account, you will need an NSC application form, passport-size photograph, PAN Card, Aadhar Card, Passport or any government-issued ID card. Transfer: You can transfer your NSC account from your name to any other individual‚Äôs name. You can also transfer from one post office to another. Nomination: You can appoint a nominee for your NSC account. Premature withdrawal: The scheme doesn‚Äôt allow premature withdrawal before the completion of the tenure. Premature withdrawal is only allowed in case the NSC holder passes away or if the court orders it. Loan against NSC: Banks will give you an 80-90% loan against your NSC investment during the tenure. Tax implications: The principal amount up to Rs 1.5 lakhs is eligible for tax deduction under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The interest is reinvested into the NSC account and hence is eligible for tax deduction. However, the interest earned in the final year is taxable as per your income tax slab rate. What is PPF or Public Provident Fund? The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a small savings scheme introduced by the government in 1968. The primary aim of the scheme is to encourage long-term savings. The scheme pays a fixed interest on 31st March every year, but it is calculated on the minimum balance in the account between the 5th and 30th of every month. PPF has a tenure of 15 years, which means your investment is locked in during the entire tenure. You can also extend the scheme in blocks of five years after the tenure ends. The Ministry of Finance decides the PPF interest rate every quarter, and for the July-September 2023 quarter, the interest rate is 7.1%. You can invest in PPF through any post office or an authorized bank. If you want a risk-free long-term investment, then PPF suits you the best. Following are the features of PPF Minimum and maximum investment: The minimum investment in PPF is Rs 500, and the maximum is Rs 1.5 lakhs per annum. You can invest more than Rs 1.5 lakhs per annum, but you will not receive any interest or tax benefits on the additional amount. Deposit frequency: You must invest at least once a year to keep your PPF account active. If you fail to invest once a year, the account will turn inactive. Joint account: The scheme doesn‚Äôt allow joint accounts. Moreover, you can only open one PPF account in your lifetime. Interest: The scheme pays a fixed interest every year",

    "question": "Credit Card Skimming",
    "answer": "Amortization: What is it? Calculator, Formulae and MoreSeptember 6, 2024Secured Credit Cards vs Unsecured Credit CardsSeptember 9, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Newspapers and news channels are full of stories on how credit cards are used to steal money and other credit card thefts. Most people today use credit cards for various uses, such as paying utility or restaurant bills, making online purchases, etc., and it is an easy target for thieves and hackers to steal personal information to use the credit card to steal money and make purchases. Credit card frauds are very common, especially credit card skimming. Fraudsters can steal your credit card information and data by using skimmers. Here is a detailed explanation of credit card skimming and how to avoid it. What is Skimming of Credit Cards? Whenever a credit card is used at an ATM or merchant location, it risks getting skimmed. Skimming is obtaining personal data from credit, debit, or ATM cards when used at an ATM or any vendor‚Äôs place. Fraudsters can alter operational ATMs or Point-of-Sale machines to attach a ‚Äòskimmer‚Äô device. The card skimmer can collect personal credit card data on the magnetic strip of the card, such as your card number, expiration date of the card, your full name, etc. Once credit card skimmers have obtained all this information, they can easily use it to make purchases, steal money from the account, or even trade the valuable information to a third party in exchange for money. What Happens When Your Data is Stolen Through Credit Card Skimming? If a credit card is skimmed, the card skimmer can make any unauthorised transactions or use the data in the following ways: Commit Identity Fraud With the information stolen, credit card skimmers can commit identity fraud, set up a duplicate account in your name, or even apply for loans under your name. Make Purchases The fraudsters can use your skimmed credit card data to make online or offline purchases. Such a theft is called ‚Äòcard-not-present‚Äô ‚Äòheft. Replicate The Card Credit card skimmers can sell the card date to other interest third parties, and then the information will be copied onto a new card. You can‚Äôt avoid using Credit Cards, but you can be more vigilant while using them! Get your Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card on Jupiter Apply Now! Common Places Where Credit Card Skimming Takes Place Any common place like a restaurant, shopping mall, petrol pump, etc., where people are most likely to use POS machines to swipe their credit cards, is the likely target for credit card skimmers to install skimmers and skim credit cards. A ATMs and Petrol Stations The most common targets are ATMs and petrol stations; many times, card skimmers are permanently installed in some ATMs. Fraudsters can also install a tiny camera near an ATM to record the card PIN whenever a customer punches in their PIN. B Retail Outlets and Restaurants Other easy targets are all the shops and restaurants, as people frequently visit these places and use their credit cards to make payments. It is easy for a gang of thieves to crack one of the shop‚Äôs helpers or a waiter in the restaurant to help them with their fraud and steal the card by wiping the card through a credit card skimmer. C Shoulder Surfing Shoulder surfing is when a skimmer pretends to be one of the people waiting in the queue and then discreetly observes your actions when you put in your card information and code to later use to make fraud mental transactions. How to Spot a Credit Card Skimmer? Credit card skimmers easily blend with ATMS and POS machines, so they are generally difficult to spot and may seem like a part or extension of the machine. But, most of the time, credit card skimmers will stick out of the card insertion panel, and it will look like an additional part is attached to the reader. Such an out-of-place extension or attachment is usually a skimmer, so always check for loose or moving parts to spot a credit card skimmer and stay alert to avoid getting scammed. What To Do If Your Credit Card Gets Skimmed? You will only realise your credit card has been skimmed if an unauthorised transaction occurs. If you notice money, even a small amount, getting deducted or you get an alert message for a significant transaction you have not authorised, be alerted that your credit card is skimmed. The good thing is that most banks and credit card lenders now use the latest fraud detection technology and can immediately block your credit card at the first sign of a ",

This risk mostly revolves around insurance, loans, and investments. In earlier times when a large portion of goods was sent as consignments on ships, the amount of risk involved was also quite high. To cover this risk, ship owners would document all the details of the goods on board. Consequently, business owners would shoulder this impending risk for a premium. That‚Äôs how underwriting became popular. How does underwriting work? Since there is a party assuming risk, underwriting involves, as a part of its process, thorough research and assessment of the risk. In other words, the underwriter will want to determine the degree of risk that an applicant is associated with before proceeding. Without this initial evaluation, it will be difficult to set a rate for borrowing of loans, build a market for securities by setting a price on investment risk, or arrive at the right amount of premium to make up for the costs of insuring a policyholder. Naturally, if there is too much risk, an underwriter has the right to refuse. By now it is quite evident that risk is the driving force in the process of underwriting. If someone borrows money, then non-payment or delayed payment is a risk. Similarly, in insurance, too many claims made at one time is a risk. And in the securities market, unprofitable underwritten investments are a risk. Underwriters try to mitigate this risk by assessing loans to understand how likely someone is to repay and whether there is a security or collateral to fall back on in the case of default. Insurance underwriters, on the other hand, evaluate a policyholder‚Äôs health and try to divide the risk among as many people as possible. Moreover, in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), underwriting of shares or securities is done so that the company‚Äôs value can be measured against the risk of purchasing its securities or shares. What does an underwriter do? In simple terms, an underwriter determines the risk-worthiness of a contract. For instance, an underwriter in banking will look at the credit risk of an applicant for a loan. It is not always the simplest thing to do. Underwriters may have to be more scrupulous and thorough, especially when the degree of risk is much higher. Read further about what exactly underwriters do in different industries. Functions of underwriters Whether it is loans or insurance, an underwriter essentially assesses, and if everything seems favorable, takes up the risk of another individual or business. However, if it seems unfavorable, an underwriter may also deny assuming the risk. Let us assume that you apply for a loan with ABC Bank and mortgage your house. The mortgage underwriter is going to evaluate the risk of approving your loan by analyzing your repayment history, credit score, and the market value of the house that you have mortgaged. They will use all this information to ascertain whether your loan should be approved in the first place. If they decide on approval, then a rate of interest will be determined for you and this will depend, to a large extent, on the degree of risk that the underwriter assumes. If you run a business and are going public for the first time, then you will have an IPO. And here is where the underwriter plays a role. If you are purchasing an insurance policy, then the insurance underwriter will evaluate your case and try to determine the chances of you submitting a claim by taking several factors into account. It is after this that they will determine your premium. Different types of underwriting As you may already know, there are three types of underwriting, which include loan, insurance, and securities. Loan or mortgage underwriting Every time you make an application for a loan at the bank, along with your documents, your credit history, bank statements, collateral (in the case of a secured loan), and other factors related to your application are assessed. Usually, this process is automated unless it needs human intervention. A human mortgage underwriter is the most commo",

    "question": "What Are the Benefits of PF?",
    "answer": "Fundamental Analysis vs Technical Analysis: Meaning and Key DifferencesJune 27, 2023Understanding Bank Account Freeze & Solutions ‚Äì Jupiter MoneyJuly 5, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle The Provident Fund (PF), which is compulsory for employees earning a monthly PF contribution of at least Rs 15,000, is commonly regarded as an investment choice aimed at retirement savings. According to Section 80C of the income tax act, employees enjoy income-tax exemption on PF contributions up to Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year. The Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) offers several additional advantages to its members. Let‚Äôs explore nine benefits of PF account. Benefits of PF that Every Salaried Person Must Know Employees‚Äô Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI) If you‚Äôre a subscriber of the Employee Provident Fund (EPF), you can now enjoy the advantage of free insurance coverage up to Rs 7 lakh in the unfortunate event of death during your service period. This coverage is made possible through the Employees‚Äô Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme. Recently, in May, the insurance benefits provided by the EDLI scheme were improved and made more flexible. The maximum amount of insurance benefit has been raised from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 7 lakh, offering greater financial security to beneficiaries. Pension Scheme for EPF account holder EPF Account holders are eligible for a lifelong pension scheme known as the Pension Scheme 1995 (EPS). Under the Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme (EPS) of 1995, a minimum monthly pension of Rs. 1,000/- has been mandated for pensioners starting from 01.09.2014. This ensures that pensioners receive a basic level of financial support through the Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme (EPS), 1995. Partial Fund Withdrawals The Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) permits partial withdrawals under specific circumstances. These include situations like a medical emergency, repayment of a home loan, construction or purchase of a new house, renovation of an existing house, and funding the wedding expenses of children or oneself. Employer and Employee Contributions In the process of building a provident fund (PF), both the employer and the employee play a role in contributing funds. Typically, the employer contributes 12% of the employee‚Äôs basic salary and dearness allowance, matching the employee‚Äôs contribution. This joint effort fosters the rapid growth of the PF fund. Tax Benefits of PF This savings scheme provides a tax exemption opportunity to individuals who hold an EPF (Employee Provident Fund) Account under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Loan against PF In case of a financial emergency, an EPF member has the option to obtain a loan with a minimal interest rate of 1%. However, this short-term loan must be repaid within 36 months from the time it is disbursed. The interest rate on employees‚Äô provident fund (EPF) deposits reached its lowest level in four decades on March 12, standing at 8.1% for the 2021-22 fiscal year compared to the previous year‚Äôs 8.5%. This represents the lowest interest rate on employee deposits towards their retirement fund since 1977-78, when it was 8%. The Central Board of Trustees (CBT), headed by Union Labour and Employment Minister Bhupendra Yadav, recommended the 8.1% interest rate during its meeting in Guwahati, according to a statement from the Ministry of Labour. Portability and Transferability Provident Fund (PF) accounts in India allow for portability, allowing workers to move their PF balance when changing jobs. This system makes sure that people can keep their PF savings without opening additional accounts. The Universal Account Number (UAN) is essential for streamlining the transfer process and making it simple to track the PF balance. Employees can easily carry over their PF savings with the help of this mechanism, which encourages financial stability and removes the hassle of managing multiple PF accounts. Online Access and Transparency Online portals and mobile applications have been introduced by the Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) to give workers easy access to and control over their PF (Provident Fund) accounts. Employees may easily check their account balance, download statements, and follow the status of their claims thanks to these services. Employees will find it simpler to be informed and in control of their financial advantages thanks to this initiative‚Äôs promotion of transparency and simplification of PF accounts‚Äô general operations.

    "question": "A Complete Guide on Real Estate Mutual Funds: ‚Äì Jupiter Money",
    "answer": "Jupiter Takes On Shady Loan App With It‚Äôs On Demand Salary MockumentrySeptember 1, 2023Best Time to Buy & Sell Mutual Funds in IndiaSeptember 8, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle For many of us, owning a house is a dream. However, with real estate prices going through the roof, owning a house remains a dream for many. This should discourage you from investing in the real estate market and make the most of this growth. There are many alternatives to investing in a house or a piece of land or house. One of the most popular alternatives is real estate mutual funds. In this article, we cover real estate mutual funds, its features, advantages and risks in detail. What are real estate mutual funds? Real estate mutual funds are sectoral funds that primarily invest in securities of real estate companies or in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). The fund manager pools money from investors and invests in these companies. So technically, the fund manager is providing the real estate companies with capital to build and develop properties. When the share price of these companies rises, or when the real estate market goes up, the mutual fund will make a profit. Following are the features of real estate mutual funds. Minimum investment: With the ever-rising prices of real estate, investing in this sector has become out of reach for the common man. However, in the case of real estate mutual funds, you can still participate in this sector with a minimum investment of Rs. 1,000. Investment horizon: Real estate is a long-term sector, as it takes time to build and sell property. Hence the ideal investment horizon for these funds is over five years. Alternative to buying a property: Real estate funds are an excellent alternative to buying a physical property. It eliminates the risk of litigation and the hassle of maintaining a property. Moreover, it also reduces the time and effort in buying a property. Returns: Real estate fund‚Äôs return depends on the real estate sector. However, in the long term, these funds can offer decent returns. Risk: Real estate funds are prone to sector risk. If the sector collapses, so will the companies in the industry, which will affect the fund. Liquidity: Real estate mutual funds are very liquid when compared to physical property. Investors can cash out their investments and get the investment proceeds in their bank account within a day. Expense ratio: Real estate mutual funds have an expense ratio similar to other mutual funds. It is usually a percentage of the investment amount. Profit sharing with long-term growth: Real estate mutual funds invest in REITs and shares of real estate companies. The fund can earn profits from REITs and enjoy long-term growth benefits from shares of real estate companies. Minimal investor‚Äôs effort: Investing in real estate funds doesn‚Äôt require you to go through a ton of paperwork, and it also reduces the hassle of finding a good property to invest in. When it comes to real estate mutual funds, the investor‚Äôs efforts are very minimal, and they get to enjoy the full benefits. Diversification: Fund managers of real estate mutual funds invest across different properties, including residential, commercial, rental, and hospitality projects. Hence as an investor, you can enjoy the benefits of a diversified portfolio of properties. No direct role of investors: As an investor in a real estate mutual fund, you will have no control over your money as the fund manager decides the portfolio of the company. Moreover, you do not own the shares of the company directly, so you won‚Äôt have any voting rights. How do real estate mutual funds work? Real estate mutual funds are similar to other equity mutual funds. The manager pools money from different investors with similar objectives and invests them in REITs and shares of real estate companies. The profits arising from the REITs are distributed to all mutual fund unit holders, whereas the capital appreciation in the shares of the real estate companies will increase your portfolio returns. Who should invest in real estate mutual funds? Real estate mutual funds best suit small investors who lack the capital to invest in real estate properties. Since the investment in real estate mutual funds is low, it is accessible to everyone. These funds also suit investors who want to gain from the real estate market boom. If you are looking to accumulate wealth from real estate, these are your go-to funds. Real estate funds ideally reap good returns in the l",

    "question": "Interest Rate Swap: Meaning, Types, Example, Advantages & Risks",
    "answer": "16 Major Factors Affecting Financial PlanningNovember 3, 2023How To Link Credit Card To UPINovember 10, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle What is an interest rate swap? An interest rate swap (IRS) is a contractual arrangement between two parties who agree to exchange interest payments for a predefined amount of money (principal) and time. These contracts are a type of derivative contracts that trade over the counter (OTC) and can be customized as per the parties‚Äô requirements. Also known as plain vanilla swaps, they usually involve an exchange of a fixed interest rate contract for a floating interest rate contract and vice versa. This will help the parties reduce or increase their exposure to interest rate fluctuations and obtain a lower interest rate. Interest rate swaps are usually used by companies when they prefer one type of interest rate over the other. In other words, if a company can obtain a fixed interest rate contract but prefers a floating interest rate contract, then it can use an interest rate swap. The major players in interest rate swaps are banks and large and small corporations. In India, the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) is the most popular benchmark swap, and the Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (MIBOR) is the floating benchmark against which companies settle swaps. How does an interest rate swap work? An interest rate swap is nothing but a simple contract where two parties exchange each other‚Äôs loan arrangement. So, if one party is paying a fixed interest rate to the bank and the other is paying a floating interest rate, but each party prefers the other‚Äôs loan arrangement over their own. Then, they will enter into a mutual agreement to exchange the loan terms. When they enter into an agreement, only the interest payments are swapped. The loan amount, tenor and other payment terms remain the same. Since the interest rate swap is a derivative contract, both parties will pay each other the difference in the loan payments. They do not pay each other‚Äôs debt, nor do they pay the full interest of the other party. A good swap contract clearly states the terms of the agreement, the payment each party has to make to the other party, the payment schedule, the start date, and the maturity date. Both parties will be bound to this interest rate swap contract until the maturity date. The primary reason why a company enters into a swap contract is to take advantage of the change in interest rates. So, the party exchanging fixed interest rates for floating believes that the interest rates can rise in the future and wants to take advantage of it and earn high-interest rates. Whereas the party earning in floating exchange rate believes that it wants to be paid at a fixed rate as it guarantees an interest payment even if interest rates fall. In a swap contract, both the parties get what they want. The company switching from fixed to floating will get exposure to earn a higher potential profit, whereas the company switching from floating to fixed wants to hedge the risk of a fall in interest rates. However, only one party will benefit from the contract. If the interest rates rise, the company receiving a floating rate will benefit from higher interest income, and the company receiving a fixed interest rate will be at a loss. Conversely, if the interest rates fall, the company receiving a floating interest rate will earn less, whereas the company with fixed interest payments will continue to receive the same interest payment. Example of an interest rate swap There are two companies, namely, ABC and DEF. Company AMC is currently paying a fixed interest to a bank for a loan (Rs 10 lakhs) it took. However, it believes that the interest rates could fall in the future and wants to benefit from the floating interest rate regime. Company DEF, on the other hand, is currently paying a floating interest rate on its bank loan (Rs 10 lakhs) but believes the interest rates could go up in the next few years, increasing its interest payments. Company ABC and DEF enter into a swap contract to swap their interest rate terms. So, Company ABC will now pay a floating interest rate, and Company DEF will pay a fixed interest rate. Let‚Äôs say the fixed interest is 5%, and the floating interest rate is MIBOR plus 1%, with MIBOR being 4% currently. To start off, both companies have the same interest payments on their loan of Rs 10 lakhs, which is Rs 50,000. After a year, if the MIBOR rate rises to 5%, then Company ABC will have to pay Company DEF the di",

This penalty amount can range from Rs. 250 to Rs. 750 levied by other banks, whereas, in Jupiter, there are no charges associated with it. These incredible features are available to the Jupiter account users only. Best thing about Jupiter is you can easily create an account in 3-minutes.

You can avoid paying additional fees, such as distributor commission, by investing directly through the AMC. This will reduce your overall expenses and can lead to higher returns than regular plans in the long term. However, this method of investing is not convenient. You don‚Äôt invest in different funds of the same fund house. Hence managing and monitoring your mutual fund investments can get slightly difficult. AMC registrar Mutual fund registrars are organizations that keep track of all activities done by investors of an AMC. They offer customized statements to investors showing the transaction history and the current value of the investments. There are two main registrar transfer agents in India: CAMS and Karvy.

Apart from providing a platform to invest, they also help track mutual fund transactions and provide data about the fund‚Äôs performance.

    "answer": "What is Loan Repayment? & Types of Loan Repayment MethodsJuly 31, 2024What is Leave Encashment? -Types, Limits, EncashmentAugust 1, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle We all secretly desire a beautiful mansion, vacations steeped in luxury, and high-end cars and gadgets, don‚Äôt we? But, fulfilling these dreams costs money‚Äîa lot of it And for most of us, money is a limited resource, something we always need to save for a rainy day. It is the medium through which we buy not only what we desire but also what we need‚Äîfood, clothing, and shelter. While the thought of spending a few weeks at a faraway cabin in the mountains is nice, the reality is that we need money to get by every day and to even get to our offices where we work to earn. So, does that mean you never spend on anything else but needs? Not necessarily. You must strike the right balance between your needs and wants and set goals that are attainable. Here‚Äôs where a personal budget plays a big role. What Is Budgeting? A budget is a plan that you create on how you will spend your money. It could be a monthly, weekly, or annual budget. Wondering what is budgeting? Well, the process of creating a budget is referred to as budgeting. A spending plan is essential because it will help you determine how much money you have to do the things you like. If you do not have sufficient funds, then you will learn how to prioritize your spending and direct your money towards the most important things. To know where you are spending the most, you need to track expenses. How to Track Expenses? Cryptocurrency, stocks, and mutual funds do sound fancy. But they mean little if we are unable to track expenses. And yes, although it might seem a little difficult to do this every month, here are some ways to make this easier for you. Categorize Expenses Every month, make a list of expenses you are likely to spend on such as grocery, rent, shopping, eating out, and so on. Assign a limit to each and stick to it. Use an Expense Tracker App There are many apps that can help you track your expenses, especially if you are left with no idea as to where all your money goes at the end of the month. A daily expenses app will let you keep track of how much you spend and on what. Since you have already assigned categories, it will become easier to analyze your expenditure at the end of the month. Have One or Two Bank Accounts To avoid confusion, stick to maintaining just one or two bank accounts. In addition to your salary account, create another savings account if you have monthly deductions in the form of systematic investment plans (SIPs) and other investments. Then, when you receive your salary, move the necessary funds to the other account and use it for the rest of your expenses. This makes it easier to track expenses. What Is a Personal Budget? Most businesses hire a financial expert to create and stick to a budget that enables them to maximize profits and minimize costs. In your case, it is up to you to become the expert money budgeter who ensures you spend your money efficiently. It is essential to create a personal budget. It is a tool to help track the inflow and outflow of money from your bank account. You and your family can use your budget as a guide on how you can spend less and save more. Importance of Budgeting Whether you are a fresher who has just landed your first job or an experienced IT professional drawing a six-figure income, a budget is a simple yet effective medium to plan your expenses and savings. The Cornerstone to Better Financial Health Budgeting plays a key role in maintaining good financial health and this is true even if you do not have a particular goal like paying off debt or saving a certain amount for retirement. When you budget, you have an idea about where you are spending and how much money you have in hand. The Tool to Balance Your Savings And Expenses When you continue to budget every month in a disciplined manner, you gradually learn how to work with limited funds. You also understand how much of your income is being spent under different heads. A budget can help you strike a balance between the income in hand and your expenses. So, every month, when you know that you have to spend a certain amount on rent, groceries, and utilities, you will keep that portion of your income aside. A budget is also how you can lay down a road map for your long-term goals such as buying a house, an early retirement, your child‚Äôs education, and so on. Different Ways to Track Expense",

    "answer": "How to Transfer Money OnlineJune 19, 2024How to Save Money to Buy Your Dream Bike?July 11, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle When you think ‚Äòhome loan‚Äô, we‚Äôre sure you think about mountains of paperwork, masked interest charges, and a bunch of regulations that don‚Äôt make sense to you. From repayment periods to rental yields and reducing interest to subvention clauses, buying a home can be more daunting than exciting when you‚Äôre looking to get a home loan. So we thought we‚Äôd decode the nuances of getting a home loan, so you can refer to this Home Loan 101, the next time you start planning to buy your dream home. Commonly used terms in Home Loan Before we get to the types of home loan, let‚Äôs first understand the common terms that you can come across when taking a home loan. Down payment: It is the minimum amount you have to pay to purchase a property and get a home loan. Usually, the down payment is around 10-20% of the value of the house. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandates banks to give 70-90% of the property value as home loans. Hence, the rest has to be funded by the buyer in the form of a down payment. Tenor: It is the total duration of the home loan. The maximum tenor of a home loan can be around 30 years. Borrowers have to pay back the principal and interest during this period. Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI): This is the monthly payment you will have to make to the bank to repay your home loan. The EMI consists of both the principal and interest and the proportion of the principal and interest keeps changing as you progress in your home loan tenor. Loan-to-value: The loan-to-value ratio is the proportion of the loan amount to the value of the house. Lenders usually give only a portion of the property‚Äôs value as a loan. This is determined by your credit history, loan amount, and property type. Fixed interest rate: When the interest rate of a loan doesn‚Äôt change throughout the tenor of the loan, then the loan is said to be a fixed-interest home loan. Floating interest rate: If the interest rate changes with market conditions, then the loan has a floating interest rate regime. The interest of your home loan is pegged to a benchmark rate such as the repo rate. Hence, whenever the repo rate changes, the loan interest rate also changes. Credit score: Credit score is an indicator of your creditworthiness. It is calculated by taking various factors into account, such as your credit history, credit utilization, length of credit, and types of credit accounts. The credit score keeps changing over the tenure of your loan based on how efficiently you repay your loans. Banks check your credit score to decide the loan amount and interest rate they can offer you. A high credit score can get you a low-interest rate. Sanction letter: It is a letter that your bank issues stating your eligibility for the loan. It contains all the details such as the loan amount, interest rate, EMI, and tenor of the loan. Collateral: Collateral is a security against which a bank gives a loan. In the case of a home loan, the property that you are investing in is a collateral against which the banks offer you a loan. Disbursement: When the banks credit the loan amount to your bank account, it is called disbursement. The disbursements can either happen in one go or in partial instalments as per your agreement with the bank and the builder. Amortization schedule: A table including details of the principal and interest component in an EMI for the entire tenure of the loan is an amortization schedule. Default: When you fail to pay an EMI, it is considered as default. Banks usually charge a certain penalty on unpaid EMIs. Prepayment: Paying a part of your home loan in advance to reduce the interest obligations is known as prepayment. The money you prepay goes towards the principal and hence reduces the total interest obligation. However, it is important to check with the bank for any prepayment penalties. Foreclosure: When you pay your entire loan balance in full in one go before the tenor of your loan is complete, then it is called foreclosure. RBI mandates banks not to change any fee or penalty for foreclosure of home loan accounts.

    "question": "Fixed Maturity Plans: Features, Pros, Cons & Investing",
    "answer": "A Comprehensive Overview to Investing in Sectoral Mutual FundsOctober 3, 2022What is Mid Cap Fund ‚Äì Overview, Features, Advantages & DisadvantagesOctober 10, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Investors find mutual fund investments more attractive for better returns and capital appreciation than traditional options like Provident Funds (PFs), National Savings Certificates (NSCs), Fixed Deposits (FDs), and so on. Fund houses or asset management companies (AMCs) manage mutual funds. They pool your money to invest it across various financial instruments. One such scheme is a fixed maturity plan (FMP) ‚Äî a close-ended debt fund that gives you a predictable rate of return. FMP in mutual funds predominantly invests in fixed income instruments whose maturity periods sync with FMP scheme tenure. This article will explore fixed maturity plans to help you make sound mutual fund investment decisions. What Are Fixed Maturity Plans In Mutual Funds? A fixed maturity plan meaning implies a fixed-tenure, close-ended mutual fund scheme with a limited investment option. It mainly invests in fixed income instruments, including commercial papers (CPs), certificates of deposit (CODs), government securities, and treasury bills. The maturity period of FMP funds could range from a few months to a few years. For instance, you have an FMP with a maturity period of 2 years. Then, your AMC would invest in debt securities with a two-year tenure, ensuring the debt instruments‚Äô maturity period does not exceed that of your FMP. How does Fixed Maturity Plan in Mutual Fund work? Different fixed-income securities with corresponding maturities make up an FMP portfolio. A fund manager makes investments in instruments so that they all mature at around the same time based on the FMP‚Äôs terms. All plan units are held until they mature on a specific date during the plan‚Äôs lifespan. Investors can therefore estimate the plan‚Äôs return rate. As you can see, the FMP funds are designed to reduce the interest rate risk. It safeguards your investments from any interest rate fluctuation during the term of the FMP scheme. Who Should Invest in FMP Funds? FMP in mutual funds is best suited for those investors who are risk averse but still want a better tax-efficient return than a regular fixed deposit (FD). Investors ready to accept continual net asset value (NAV) fluctuations can opt for a fixed maturity plan. NAV implies a mutual fund‚Äôs scheme unit price based on which mutual funds are purchased or sold. As FMP has limited liquidity with a lock-in period, investors with an urgent need of funds can consider investing their money in an FMP over the NFO maturity period. How to Invest in a Fixed Maturity Plan? Investors can invest only in a fixed maturity plan during a new fund offer (NFO) scheme by an AMC based on subscription requests. It is pertinent to note that post the NFO completion period, you cannot make any new investments in the said FMP scheme. As per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), mutual fund houses need to provide investors with ways for an early redemption from the scheme. Closed-ended schemes like FMPs can be redeemed earlier than their maturity period when they are listed on a stock exchange. You can thus buy or sell FMP units when they get listed on a recognised stock exchange. Otherwise, investors cannot freely enter or exit an FMP anytime in fixed-period mutual funds. What Are The Features of an FMP? Here are the key features of the FMP: Fixed period plans FMP funds have a fixed lock-in period during which you cannot withdraw the investment in the said scheme. The primary purpose of having rigid withdrawal guidelines for a fixed maturity plan is to generate optimum returns for the scheme during the lock-in period. You can select the FMP based on your investment goals and liquidity requirements. Investment approach Fund managers mainly invest fixed maturity plans in fixed income instruments like CODs, CPs, and good companies, which mature in line with the FMP‚Äôs maturity period. Closed-ended funds As FMP funds are closed-ended schemes, you can invest only during the initial NFO period like the FMP maturity plan 2021, and redeem the series on the scheme‚Äôs maturity. Investors who invest in FMP units via Demat mode can redeem them by selling them on the stock exchange where the FMP scheme units are listed.

    "answer": "Equity Investment in India 2023: Equity Investment Types, Benefits & MoreSeptember 29, 2022Best Investment Options in India 2023: Investment Plans for High ReturnsSeptember 29, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Fund Of Funds: Meaning, Benefits, Risks & Returns Is it possible for a mutual fund to invest in another fund? Yes, it is totally possible through fund of funds. Fund of funds is mutual funds that invest in other mutual funds and hedge funds. Based on the investment objective, the fund pools investors‚Äô money and invests in other funds. They invest in both domestic and international funds. Read on to find out more about how fund of funds work, their types, and how they are taxed. How do funds work? Fund of funds is just like mutual funds. They pool money from investors with similar objectives and invest based on the fund‚Äôs objective. However, they don‚Äôt invest in stocks, bonds, or money market instruments. They invest in other funds by buying their units. The underlying investments are mutual funds of the same fund house or other fund houses. The fund suits investors with different risk profiles and financial goals. They are also the most diversified funds as they invest in multiple funds. Who should invest in a fund of funds? Fund of funds suits small investors who want exposure to a diverse range of securities for a small investment. These funds invest in multiple domestic and international funds; hence are very diversified. Investors looking for diversification in their investments can consider them. Fund of fund is also suitable for a long investment horizon. Hence investors with long-term goals who want to earn maximum returns can consider investing in them. Types of funds of funds Asset allocation funds These funds invest in asset classes such as equities, debt securities, gold, metals, and commodities. They offer in-build diversification to investors. Investing in multiple asset classes lowers the risk of one particular asset in the portfolio. The other asset classes negate the underperformance of one asset class. Hence, these funds mostly suit investors with low-risk tolerance levels. Asset allocation funds can also give better returns due to exposure to multiple asset classes. Investors looking for good returns with low risk can invest in them. Gold funds Gold funds are open-ended mutual funds that directly or indirectly invest in gold. Fund managers either invest in physical gold or stocks of gold mining companies. They are much better than investing in physical gold as there is no loss due to theft or loss in value. Moreover, you will not have to pay GST when you invest in gold funds, which is not the case when you buy gold jewellery. These suit investors who want to diversify their portfolio to a different asset class, such as gold. Gold funds can be used as a hedge against stock market volatility and inflation. Despite the short-term dips, or spikes, gold has been a go-to asset for Indian households. Over the years, the value of gold has grown steadily in the long term. They are ideal for long-term goals and investors who want to generate good returns over the long term. International fund of funds These funds invest in international funds. International funds invest in stocks and securities of global companies. They give exposure to foreign securities and help in geographically diversifying a portfolio. Investing in these funds can also get exposure to other currencies. By investing in rupees, you can get exposure to multiple currencies and benefit from currency depreciation. Multi-manager fund of funds A multi-manager fund consists of many professionally managed funds. The fund of funds is overseen by one fund manager, who might offer investment advice to multiple fund managers. Alternatively, the fund manager can hire different fund managers to manage a portion of the fund. ETF fund of funds A fund of funds that has exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a portfolio is an ETF fund of funds. Investing in this fund is more accessible than investing in an ETF. This is because you don‚Äôt need a demat account to invest in an ETF fund of funds. Nevertheless, these funds can be risky as they are more susceptible to market volatility. Things to consider as an investor Before investing in a fund of fund, you will have to consider the following parameters: Liquidity: Fund of funds are best for long-term goals and operate in the long term. Hence, they are less liquid in nature. It is best if investors with short-term g",

    "question": "CTC vs Gross Salary vs Net Salary: Understanding the Key Differences, Calculation, and Take-Home Pay in India",
    "answer": "Need Money Urgently? Best Ways You Can Get Fast CashMarch 1, 2024Top 10 Strongest Currency in the World ‚Äì 2025March 13, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Ever wondered why your pay check doesn‚Äôt always match the salary you were promised? The answer lies in the terms CTC, gross salary, and net salary. These terms are often used interchangeably, but they represent different amounts of money. In this guide, we‚Äôll break down the differences between these terms, helping you understand what you‚Äôre actually taking home each month. What Is CTC? Cost to Company (CTC) refers to the total expense a company incurs for employing an individual. It includes various components beyond just the basic salary. These components typically consist of allowances such as House Rent Allowance (HRA), Provident Fund (PF), and Medical Insurance. In addition to these standard benefits, CTC can cover perks like free meals or meal vouchers (like Sodexo), office space rent, transportation services to and from work, and even subsidised loans. When you add all these elements together, you get the complete Cost to Company. In simple terms, CTC represents what a company spends on hiring and supporting an employee. It can change based on different factors, which means the employee‚Äôs take-home pay can also vary. To align their expectations with reality, individuals can compare their CTC with the actual salary they receive. The formula to calculate an employee‚Äôs Cost to Company (CTC) is: CTC = Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance + House Rent Allowance + Conveyance Allowance + Medical Allowance + Special Allowance + Employer‚Äôs Contribution to Provident Fund + Employee‚Äôs Contribution to Provident Fund + Employer‚Äôs Contribution to Employee State Insurance + Performance Bonus + Other Allowances + Gratuity The components of CTC have been explained in detail later. What Is Gross Salary? Gross salary refers to the total amount of money an employer pays an employee before any deductions, like taxes or retirement contributions. It‚Äôs the full payment for your work, representing the financial offer from your company in return for your efforts. When people talk about the Cost to Company (CTC), they mean the complete gross salary plus any additional benefits. However, the amount you actually take home, or net salary, is lower because it doesn‚Äôt include these deductions. In simple terms, gross salary is your monthly or yearly pay before anything is taken out. What is Net Salary or Take Home Salary? Net salary is the amount of money an employee takes home after all deductions are made from their gross salary. This includes taxes, insurance, retirement contributions, and any other withholdings. Essentially, it‚Äôs what you actually receive in your pay check and can spend or save. What Is The Difference Between CTC and Gross Salary? What Is the Difference Between CTC and Gross Salary is that CTC (Cost to Company) is the total amount an employer spends on an employee, including salary, allowances, and benefits like PF, insurance, and gratuity. Gross Salary is the total amount earned before deductions, including basic salary and allowances. CTC is higher than Gross Salary, and Gross Salary is higher than Net Salary (take-home salary after taxes and deductions). Parameters CTC Gross Salary Definition CTC represents the total amount spent by an employer on an employee throughout the year. This includes all costs associated with employment. Gross salary is the total income an employee earns before any deductions like taxes or retirement contributions. Purpose It helps employers understand their total financial commitment and plan their budgets accordingly. It gives employees an idea of their total earnings, which is important for understanding potential tax liabilities. Components CTC includes the basic salary, fixed allowances (like transportation or medical), variable allowances, benefits (like meal coupons), and contributions made by the employer to retirement funds. Gross salary comprises the basic salary, house rent allowance, and other applicable allowances, which provide a clearer picture of monthly income. Amount Comparison CTC is usually higher than the gross salary because it encompasses all costs associated with employment. Gross salary is less than CTC but more than what employees take home after deductions. Variability CTC can vary significantly based on factors like bonuses, performance incentives, and additional benefits that the employer may provide. Gross salary is typ",

    "question": "Recurring Deposit: Features, Benefits, Eligibility & Interest Rates",
    "answer": "How To Choose Recurring Deposit Interest Rates from Top BanksNovember 23, 2022PMS V/S Mutual Funds: Meaning, Benefits and ComparisonDecember 6, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Confused about what to do with those savings you saved from your blood-sweat earnings? Don‚Äôt worry there are many ways to deal with it but do you know the best way? It‚Äôs investing your money in a recurring deposit. Now you must be thinking about what a recurring deposit is and how it works. Well, all you have to do is read the following article to know all your answers. What is recurring deposit? A recurring deposit is one that is made on a regular basis. Many banks offer this service, which allows people to make gets additional and earn good returns for investors. A recurring deposit account is a postal service account or a kind of financial service into which a depositor regularly deposits a decent amount of money each month for a certain period of time. The concept of producing small monthly savings through the recurring deposit Plan allows the user to accumulate an appealing sum at maturity. The interest rates on recurring deposits are determined by calculating on an annual financial compounded basis. A regular fixed deposit entails putting money aside that can be withdrawn after a certain period of time. In the meantime, you are unable to change or supplement the amount of money. The recurring deposit procedure is similar, with one major difference. Rather than making an investment in a lump sum, you should deposit a set amount into your RD in bank account each month, as determined when you opened your account. This may be a small sum that will not deplete your savings account. And when the money matures, you‚Äôll have a large sum that is greater than your principal plus interest. Features And Benefits of Recurring Deposit Account The following are the primary features and benefits of a Recurring Deposit account: Mostly all banks in India offer a Recurring Deposit scheme with terms ranging from 6 months to 10 years, giving customers the flexibility to choose what works best for them. Interest rates differ from one bank to the next and are also affected by the term of the loan. RD provides you with a fixed interest rate on your invested amount at a set frequency until the term ends or you reach maturity. At the end of the term, you will be paid the amount upon maturity (which is your invested capital) plus any residual or managed to accumulate interest. The goal of recurring deposit schemes is to instill in the public a regular saving habit. The minimum deposit amount tends to vary from bank to bank. It could be little for instance Rs.10. Recurring deposits assist the average person in developing the habit of saving on a regular basis. Once determined, the interest rate will apply for the duration of the loan. Once the RD in a bank account is opened, the interest rate will not change. Recurring Deposit allows you to borrow against your savings. Most banks lend up to 80 percent to 90 percent of the account holder‚Äôs savings. Most banks now offer the option of automatically deducting the RD amount from the savings account. This feature of a recurring deposit account will benefit the individual by preventing missed payments. Types of Recurring Deposit Accounts There are many recurring deposit types you should know for better understanding. Regular RD accounts: Regular recurring deposit accounts can be opened by Indian residents over the age of 18. Account holders deposit a set amount into the account once a month for a set period of time, earning a set interest rate. Interest will be determined by calculating using compound or concise methods depending on the account‚Äôs tenure. Minors are handled by RD: Individuals under the age of 18 may open accounts in their names, but only with the permission of their parents or guardians. A fixed monthly installment in the series and tenure will be determined when the account is opened. Returns may be comparable or slightly higher when compared to regular RD in bank accounts. Senior citizens‚Äô RD accounts: Banks offer senior citizens, those over the age of 60, a committed RD account. Senior citizens may be more interested in RD than regular clients. This interest is aggravated on a quarterly basis. Accounts for NRE/NRO RDs: Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) can open RD account balances for External (NRE) or Normal (NRO) purposes. NRIs can earn a good rate of interest and save on income managed to earn both within and ",

    "answer": "How Much Money Do You Need to Retire?May 16, 2023Can an Indian Buy Property in USA?May 19, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Too much impulsive and unnecessary shopping paired with unused subscriptions to activities and OTT, along with a lack of financial discipline, can make you go broke before you can even reach the end of the month. If you find yourself in a cash crunch almost every month, it‚Äôs time to sharpen your savings knife.

How Much of Salary to Save? Saving every month depends on your income as it limits how much money is saved. Hence, your income is one of the major deciding factors that play an essential part in determining how much to save. But exactly how much of your salary should you save? The answer to this question is nothing concrete since everyone earns and lives differently and has separate goals for saving. Yet, you must remember one thing when managing your salary: focusing on increasing your savings rather than running behind in increasing your income. Follow the 50-30-20 rule of budgeting to save money from salary. This rule divides your salary into three parts: 50% for monthly living expenses (needs), 30% for lifestyle expenses (wants), and 20% for savings. 10 Practical Tips on How to Save Money From Salary Every Month In today‚Äôs uncertain economy, saving money each month from your income has become a necessity. Moreover, saved money helps create a safe financial net for emergencies and for building future financial security. But where to begin?

It may seem daunting, but it‚Äôs not extensive work. No, you don‚Äôt have to maintain a giant registry to track all your little daily expenses, but we are simply asking you to begin noting down the spending and savings happening every month. Noting down these things will help you gain a clear picture of the money you are spending on unnecessary things and track the amount of salary going into saving. Track Your Monthly Finances Forming the habit of tracking your expenses from your income is great, especially when done right from the beginning of your financial journey. This helps in creating financial discipline. To track your expenses, begin by noting your monthly salary and then document the monthly expense that goes around. This should be both fixed and variable categories: Fixed expenses: This category includes the necessities like electricity bills, house rent, water bills, essential groceries, commutes, and other unavoidable expenses. Variable expenses: Under this classification, recurring payments are placed, like medical bills, travel expenses, eating out, and more. Tracking your monthly expenditures is essential, but doing them manually is a hassle and can be prone to human errors like missing out on a small but significant expense. So, what‚Äôs the solution?

These include impulse shopping, unused subscriptions, eating out, and other unnecessary costs. They are luxuries that can be ignored or reduced, and the money saved can be added to your savings cap.

    "question": "What Are the Benefits of PF?",
    "answer": "Fundamental Analysis vs Technical Analysis: Meaning and Key DifferencesJune 27, 2023Understanding Bank Account Freeze & Solutions ‚Äì Jupiter MoneyJuly 5, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle The Provident Fund (PF), which is compulsory for employees earning a monthly PF contribution of at least Rs 15,000, is commonly regarded as an investment choice aimed at retirement savings. According to Section 80C of the income tax act, employees enjoy income-tax exemption on PF contributions up to Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year. The Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) offers several additional advantages to its members. Let‚Äôs explore nine benefits of PF account. Benefits of PF that Every Salaried Person Must Know Employees‚Äô Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI) If you‚Äôre a subscriber of the Employee Provident Fund (EPF), you can now enjoy the advantage of free insurance coverage up to Rs 7 lakh in the unfortunate event of death during your service period. This coverage is made possible through the Employees‚Äô Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme. Recently, in May, the insurance benefits provided by the EDLI scheme were improved and made more flexible. The maximum amount of insurance benefit has been raised from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 7 lakh, offering greater financial security to beneficiaries. Pension Scheme for EPF account holder EPF Account holders are eligible for a lifelong pension scheme known as the Pension Scheme 1995 (EPS). Under the Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme (EPS) of 1995, a minimum monthly pension of Rs. 1,000/- has been mandated for pensioners starting from 01.09.2014. This ensures that pensioners receive a basic level of financial support through the Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme (EPS), 1995. Partial Fund Withdrawals The Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) permits partial withdrawals under specific circumstances. These include situations like a medical emergency, repayment of a home loan, construction or purchase of a new house, renovation of an existing house, and funding the wedding expenses of children or oneself. Employer and Employee Contributions In the process of building a provident fund (PF), both the employer and the employee play a role in contributing funds. Typically, the employer contributes 12% of the employee‚Äôs basic salary and dearness allowance, matching the employee‚Äôs contribution. This joint effort fosters the rapid growth of the PF fund. Tax Benefits of PF This savings scheme provides a tax exemption opportunity to individuals who hold an EPF (Employee Provident Fund) Account under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Loan against PF In case of a financial emergency, an EPF member has the option to obtain a loan with a minimal interest rate of 1%. However, this short-term loan must be repaid within 36 months from the time it is disbursed. The interest rate on employees‚Äô provident fund (EPF) deposits reached its lowest level in four decades on March 12, standing at 8.1% for the 2021-22 fiscal year compared to the previous year‚Äôs 8.5%. This represents the lowest interest rate on employee deposits towards their retirement fund since 1977-78, when it was 8%. The Central Board of Trustees (CBT), headed by Union Labour and Employment Minister Bhupendra Yadav, recommended the 8.1% interest rate during its meeting in Guwahati, according to a statement from the Ministry of Labour. Portability and Transferability Provident Fund (PF) accounts in India allow for portability, allowing workers to move their PF balance when changing jobs. This system makes sure that people can keep their PF savings without opening additional accounts. The Universal Account Number (UAN) is essential for streamlining the transfer process and making it simple to track the PF balance. Employees can easily carry over their PF savings with the help of this mechanism, which encourages financial stability and removes the hassle of managing multiple PF accounts. Online Access and Transparency Online portals and mobile applications have been introduced by the Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) to give workers easy access to and control over their PF (Provident Fund) accounts. Employees may easily check their account balance, download statements, and follow the status of their claims thanks to these services. Employees will find it simpler to be informed and in control of their financial advantages thanks to this initiative‚Äôs promotion of transparency and simplification of PF accounts‚Äô general operations.

If an employee does not utilize all of their entitled leave, they have the option to receive payment for the unused days, which is known as leave encashment. Leave encashment is an important part of your employment contract, so it‚Äôs important to understand what you need to know. Knowing how leave encashment works will help you plan for your time off and ensure that you‚Äôre taking full advantage of the benefits you‚Äôve earned. In this article, we‚Äôll discuss what leave encashment is, how it works and when it can be used. What is Leave Encashment? Leave encashment refers to the process of an employee receiving payment in exchange for their unused paid leave days, such as vacation or sick leave, that are entitled to them by their employer. In other words, instead of taking time off from work, an employee can choose to receive compensation for the equivalent number of leave days they have accumulated but not used. The terms of leave encashment, including the maximum number of days that can be encashed, are usually determined by the employer‚Äôs policies or local labour laws. What is the Limit of Leave Encashment Exemption in Budget 2023? The Indian government has recently increased the tax exemption limit for the salaried person on leave encashment on separation from non-government salaried employers from Rs. 3 lahks to Rs. 25 lahks, according to the latest Budget announcement made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The term ‚Äúseparation‚Äù includes various events such as retirement, resignation, or any other circumstances that lead an individual to leave their job. The previous limit of Rs. 3 lakh was set in 2002 when the highest basic pay in the government was Rs. 30,000 per month. Sitharaman‚Äôs proposal is in line with the increase in government salaries and aims to offer more financial relief to non-government employees. This increase in the tax exemption limit will provide non-government employees with the opportunity to receive higher tax exemptions on their leave encashment benefits, thereby enabling them to better utilize their accumulated leave days. What Are the Different Types of Leaves Offered in an Organization in India? 1. Casual Leaves Casual leave is the most popular type of leave that employees request to take time off for vacations, rest, family events, or simply to unwind and recharge. It is an essential component of maintaining a healthy work-life balance for employees. As individuals must be able to have a life outside of work, having time off to travel, attend events, participate in important life events, and spend time with family is crucial. Providing adequate casual leave options is vital to ensure employees have enough time to focus and prioritize life when needed. This leads to employees feeling valued and appreciated by their employers. In India, companies typically offer one to two casual leaves per month, with the exact number varying from state to state. Although there is no legal provision specifying the number of casual leaves, most companies provide employees with eight to fifteen casual leaves annually. It is important to note that casual leaves cannot be clubbed with other types of leaves and cannot be carried forward or encashed. These restrictions help ensure that employees use their allotted leave days to maintain a healthy work-life balance throughout the year. 2. Earned Leaves or Privilege Leaves A privilege or earned leave is an annual entitlement for employees who work in a company for a year. In India, the customary practice is to offer 18 earned leaves to employees, but the exact number of privileged leaves can vary from one organization to another. If employees wish to utilize their earned leave days, they are required to obtain formal approval from their managers in advance. Typically, unauthorized absences are adjusted against earned leaves. Employees are usually motivated by their earned leaves mentioned in their employment contract, as these annual leaves can be encashed if they are not used within the year. This feature allows employees the flexibility to utilize their earned leaves according to their needs or encash them for additional financial benefits. In addition, earned l",

    "answer": "What is Salary Slip- Components of Salary Slip, Format & Payslip BreakdownMarch 26, 2025Overspending ‚Äì Psychology, Meaning, Reasons, And Techniques to StopMarch 27, 2025 remuneration Table of Contents Toggle As an employer, it is important to know that compensation to your personnel includes more than their basic pay. It comprises several potentially taxable benefits. Having an understanding of which types of compensation are included in remuneration and its tax implications is beneficial. It helps you to make an informed decision on the benefits you would like to offer your employees. Read on to learn more about remuneration. What is Remuneration? As per Oxford Learner‚Äôs Dictionaries, remuneration means ‚Äúan amount of money that is paid to somebody for the work they have done‚Äù. It is the total compensation paid to the employees for their services. In addition to the basic salary, it includes benefits like commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, and other financial compensation paid by the employers to their personnel. Perks may or may not be a component of the employee‚Äôs compensation. For example, a generous holiday plan and an on-site gymnasium are perks but these do not offer any monetary benefits to the employees. Therefore, it can include direct monetary payouts or other taxable fringe benefits like the use of a corporate vehicle. How Does Remuneration Work? Companies can set up their own structures for the remuneration of employees as long as these adhere to the government rules and regulations. Some of these are as follows: Working hours can vary from one state to another; however, the national standard is set at a maximum of nine hours per day and 48 hours per week; any additional hours are compensated at double the normal rate. Employees shouldn‚Äôt work more than two hours per day as overtime. There is a national minimum wage rate, which is INR 176 per day in 2021; however, some state and local governments may apply their own minimum wage rates based on the skills of the employees and industries. Several workers are eligible for statutory bonuses; employees working in a company that employs at least 20 people and earns less than INR 10,000 per month are entitled to receive bonuses between 8.33% and 20% of their yearly salary. Employees who have worked for at least five years with a company are eligible for a severance pay calculated as 15 days‚Äô wages for every year of employment. Types of Remuneration There are different types of remuneration based on the type of worker and the kind of work they do. Some of these include the following: Salary The basic salary is the base compensation paid to the employees and often comprises between 35% and 50% of the total pay. It is a pre-determined amount paid before any increases or reductions. If you want to calculate your salary, you can do so with our free salary calculator which helps you understand what are the tax components, deductions and net salary. Wages Wages are monetary compensations paid to the employees in exchange for completed work or providing a service. The amount can be fixed (piece rate or task wage) for every task that is to be completed. Wages can also be paid at an hourly or daily rate (wage labor) or based on any other measurable quantity of completed work. Commission In addition to the regular salary remuneration, some employers may offer sales commissions to their people. Some companies may offer only commission-based jobs where the compensation varies based on different work variables, which are often determined by the employers. For example, the commission may depend on the quantum of sales, frequency of sales, number of customers brought, and performance. The commission is generally a percentage of the pre-determined variable. Bonus Bonus is generally the compensation given to employees over and above their annual remuneration/ pay. This amount is paid in addition to the base salary of the employees and may be used as a reward or recognition of the employees‚Äô achievements. Bonuses can be variable; however, most often these are performance-based. This means that companies distribute bonuses based on the performance of individual employees or team contributions. Most bonuses are discretionary where the manager decides on who is eligible to receive it and the quantum. Non-discretionary bonuses are a part of the employee contract. Incentives Incentives are used to motivate employees to improve their performance. These can be cash or non-cash incentive",

    "answer": "NSC vs PPF ‚Äì Which is One is Better For You? ‚Äì Jupiter MoneyOctober 6, 202311 Best Savings Schemes for Women to Become Financially IndependentOctober 25, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle A company raises funds to run and expand its business either from its shareholders or from creditors. It can raise short or long-term debts from the creditors. While taking debt isn‚Äôt wrong, it is important to assess a company‚Äôs ability to repay its debt, especially the long-term ones. Solvency ratios are an important indicator to determine a company‚Äôs long-term financial health and how effectively it can pay back its debt. Read to find out more about the different types of solvency ratios and how to calculate them. What are solvency ratios? An investor must assess a company‚Äôs creditworthiness before investing in it, and solvency ratios help with the same. They help in assessing a company‚Äôs ability to repay its long-term debt obligations. By understanding whether a company can repay its long-term debt or not, you can assess its current financial health. Not just investors, lenders, suppliers, and even customers of a business can use this ratio to ascertain whether a company is able to fulfil its fixed financial obligations. It is important to check the solvency ratios of a company from time to time to understand its financial stability. A business owner must also check the solvency ratios to decide whether the capital structure of the company needs a rejig or whether or not to take additional debt. Solvency ratios also help in understanding how the financial obligations of a business affect its cash flows and also help in projecting future cash flows. They also help in evaluating the financial risk by assessing how a company distributes its cashflows to cover long-term liabilities. Solvency ratios are calculated using several parameters, including the short and long-term debts, interest, and operating profits of a business. Let us now look at the different types of solvency ratios which are used to analyse a company‚Äôs financial health. Types of solvency ratios Interest coverage ratio The interest coverage ratio is a solvency ratio that determines how well a company can pay its interest obligations. It is used by lenders, creditors, and investors to analyse whether the company is generating enough profit to pay its interest expense. The following is the formula to calculate the interest coverage ratio: Interest coverage ratio = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) / Interest expense. Where EBIT is the operating profit of the company Interest expense is the interest payable on short and long-term borrowings of the company. Let‚Äôs understand this better with an example if a company has a revenue of Rs 100 crore, cost of goods of Rs 40 crore, operating expenses of Rs 10 crore, and interest expense of Rs 20 crore. Then, the interest coverage ratio is calculated as follows. EBIT = Revenue (Rs 100 crore) ‚Äì Cost of goods (Rs 40 crore) ‚Äì operating expenses (Rs 10 crore). EBIT = Rs 50 crore. Interest coverage ratio = Rs 50 crore / Rs 20 crore Interest coverage ratio = 2.5x This means the company is able to generate 2.5 times the profits to meet the current interest expense. A high-interest coverage ratio is always better as it indicates good financial health and also gives the company enough room to accommodate the volatility in interest rate changes. In contrast, a low ratio indicates that the company is generating low operating profits to meet its interest payments and is more vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations. Debt-to-equity ratio The debt-to-equity ratio determines what is the proportion of total debt against the company‚Äôs equity. In other words, it tells the contribution of shareholders and creditors to the total capital employed by the company. The following is the formula to calculate the debt-to-equity ratio: Debt-to-equity ratio = Total liabilities / Equity Where, total liabilities are the total debt of the company, including short-term debt, long-term debt and other fixed payments. Equity or shareholders equity is the total sum of money the company owes to the shareholders. Let‚Äôs see how the debt-to-equity ratio is calculated. If a company has total liabilities of Rs 500 crores and its shareholders equity is Rs 1,500 crores. Then, the debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as follows: Debt-to-equity ratio = Rs 500 crores / Rs 1,500 crores Debt-to-equity ratio = 0.33 This means a company is using 33% of the capital from borrowed fun",

A well-balanced portfolio has different asset classes, such as equities, fixed-income securities, real estate, and commodities. Within each asset class, there are a host of options available. For example, take fixed-income securities; we have government securities, debt mutual funds, and fixed deposits. Each of them has their own set of pros and cons. In this article, we will look at two of the most popular fixed-income securities, namely, liquid funds vs FD and understand how they differ from each other. Let‚Äôs see Liquid funds vs FD! What Are liquid funds? Liquid funds are a type of debt fund that invests primarily in money market instruments such as treasury bills, commercial paper, and other short-term government securities. Also known as money market funds, they have a maturity period ranging from 7 days to 91 days. They are low-risk investments and offer higher returns than bank fixed deposits. Liquid funds are an ideal alternative for investors looking to park their excess money for 2-3 months. Features And Benefits of Liquid Funds Minimum investment: Liquid funds have a meagre minimum investment. You can invest in a liquid fund with an amount as low as Rs 100. Entry and exit load: The fund doesn‚Äôt charge any entry or exit load. You can exit within a day of investment without any penalty. Expense ratio: Liquid funds have a low expense ratio ranging from 0.2% to 0.5%, which is relatively lower than other kinds of mutual funds. Returns: Liquid funds give predictable returns ranging from 8-9% per annum. This is higher than savings accounts and fixed deposits. However, the returns are fixed and may vary based on market conditions. Liquidity: Liquid funds are highly liquid and can be withdrawn anytime without penalty. Risk: Liquid funds are not entirely risk-free and are exposed to credit risk or default risk of the underlying securities. Hence it is important to check the credit rating of the underlying securities before investing in them. Who Can Invest in Liquid Funds? All investors are eligible to invest in liquid funds. However, these funds best suit investors with short-term goals and have excess cash. Since they are low-risk investments, investors with low-risk tolerance can also consider investing in these funds. Moreover, liquid funds give predictable returns. So investors looking to diversify their investment portfolio can invest in them to manage the downside risk of their portfolio. Things to Consider Before Investing in Liquid Funds Financial goals: Before investing in liquid funds, you must align your financial goals with the fund‚Äôs goal. This is important because it will help you find the fund that will best suit your requirements. Investment horizon: Liquid funds have a very short horizon of three months. Hence you must make sure you invest in them only for your short-term goals. Returns: Liquid funds give higher returns than savings accounts and fixed deposits but lower returns than equity funds. Moreover, the returns aren‚Äôt fixed but predictable. However, most liquid funds give returns in the range of 7%-9%. Before investing in them, check their past performance and compare different liquid funds. Invest in the ones which have consistently performed well in the past. Cost: There is a wide range of liquid funds available, and you must choose a fund with the lowest expense ratio to ensure your returns are maximised. Risk: Liquid funds are low-risk investments and are not affected by interest rate risk. However, they are affected by credit risk. Hence before investing in them, make sure you pick funds with the highest credit rating so the default risk is minimum. What Are Fixed Deposits? Fixed deposits (FD) have been the go-to investments for the majority of the population for ages now. Even today, they are one of the most popular investment avenues. Banks and financial institutions offer fixed deposits at a fixed rate of interest for a fixed tenure. Fixed deposits are financial instruments that require you to invest a fixed sum of money for a fixed duration and fixed interest rate. The bank or financial institution will pay you the interest at regular intervals or at the time of maturity. You can choose t",

How to Order PVC Card?August 22, 2024Guide to Tax-Saving Investments AvenuesAugust 22, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Most Indians dream of owning a home where they can live peacefully with their family. It brings a sense of security and peace of mind. And, once people own a house, they consider investing in other properties to earn regular interest.

So, people often opt for home loans to buy their house or invest in a property. Today, you can purchase a property by paying 10% to 20% as a down payment and get a loan for the remaining amount. You can then repay it over the next 30 years of your life. Although the biggest challenge of availing of a home loan is its high interest rate, there is no reason to worry. Read on some simple tricks to lower the interest rate on housing finance. You can check how to save money on Home Loan, by using our Home Loan EMI calculator: Free Home Loan EMI Calculator Check your home loan EMI, prepayment and savings on interest with our free Home Loan EMI Calculator Calculate My EMI & Savings Tips to reduce home loan interest payments If you want to enjoy the lowest home loan interest rate, here are the six things you can do. 1. Choose a short tenure The loan repayment tenure is an important aspect that helps you to lower your home loan interest rate. When you pay the loan amount over an extended period, the Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) will be low. So, you might think that longer tenure is an affordable option. But the more time you take to repay the amount, the higher will be the total interest paid as the number of EMIs will be more. So, choosing a shorter repayment tenure might be inexpensive in the long run. Before getting a loan, you must compare both options in terms of the total cost. 2. Pay more as the down payment One of the most effective ways to reduce loan interest is to pay a higher down payment amount. You may consider paying the least amount as a down payment to protect your savings, but that also means you need to take a significantly huge loan. When you opt for a higher down payment, the loan amount decreases, which directly lowers the payable interest. So, if you can manage to pay a substantial amount upfront, it is always better to do so rather than availing of a huge home loan. 3. Pay more than your regular EMI Home loans have long repayment tenures, which means you have to keep paying the interest over an extended period. One way to counter that is by increasing the EMI amount over time. As you progress in your profession, your salary will increase, enabling you to pay a higher EMI. So, find out if your lender allows the option to increase EMI as that will let you repay the loan early, shortening the tenure. As already explained, a shorter tenure leads to a lower interest payment. 4. Take advantage of regular prepayment Suppose you have taken a home loan of ‚Çπ50 lakhs with a repayment tenure of 20 years and an interest rate of 9% per year, you will have to pay ‚Çπ45,000 as EMI, which will lead to a total interest payment of around ‚Çπ58 lakhs. But you can avoid repaying the total amount of ‚Çπ1.08 crores with regular prepayments. When you pay an additional amount with the EMI to reduce the outstanding principal, it is known as prepayment. Your loan amount stays the same, but your income will undoubtedly increase with time. Let us assume that you earn enough to make regular prepayments after three years of availing of the loan. So, if you start paying ‚Çπ2 lakhs every six months in addition to your EMI, the housing loan interest will be charged on the reduced outstanding balance only. You will be able to repay the entire loan amount in approximately 10 years, and the total due interest payment will be ‚Çπ28 lakhs. So, you can end up saving ‚Çπ28 lakhs in interest amount with regular repayments. 5. Opt for a home loan balance transfer Opting for Home Loan Balance Transfer (HLBT) to another lender offering low-interest home loans can help you reduce the interest amount. This option allows you to transfer your outstanding amount from your current lender to another one offering a better deal. But before you choose HLBT, you must keep in mind the below points. The new lender must offer a lower interest rate than the current one. The new lender must not ask for high",

    "question": "Virtual Credit Cards ‚Äì What is it? How to get one?",
    "answer": "What is Credit Card LimitAugust 8, 2024mAadhaar App ‚Äì What is it? Features, Limitations and Functionality of the AppAugust 9, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Instances of credit card fraud have become daily news over the last few years. These cards come with multiple utilities that make it practically impossible to stop using them. So, how do you continue to benefit from credit cards and protect yourself against scams too? The answer lies in a virtual credit card (VCC). If you are not aware of what it is, read on to learn everything you need to know about it. What Is Virtual Credit Card? A VCC is a unique number that is linked to your primary credit card account. It lets you make transactions from your existing credit card account without using your card‚Äôs account number. So, the original credit card details remain unexposed when you use the VCC. It comes with a lot of flexibility as you can set an expiry date and spending limit for the VCC. You can also decide to use it with one seller only and set the limits accordingly. Some credit card issuers also allow you to delete or lock a VCC account number. This facility ensures that you do not have to change or delete your primary card account due to any fear of fraud. You can then create a new virtual account to continue making transactions. The original credit card remains unexposed when you use a VCC, eliminating any possibility of unauthorized purchases. Do you want a Virtual Credit Card with Jupiter?

Benefits and Features of Virtual Credit Cards Now that you understand what is a virtual credit card, let us look at its five key features and benefits. 1. Improved security The primary purpose of VCCs is to eliminate risks, they ensure security with multiple benefits. To begin with, you have the option to use these cards only once while the virtual number stays active for 24 hours to 48 hours. Further, the VCCs are available online only, eliminating the possibility of theft or loss. Moreover, making transactions using VCC requires generating a one-time password (OTP), which makes the card even more secure. Some issuers also let you cancel the virtual card when you need to, further reducing any risk. 2. Immediate availability When you apply for a VCC, the card company issues it online. You can access the online virtual credit card immediately for transactions as soon as it is available. You do not have to wait for it to arrive by mail or collect it from the issuer‚Äôs branch office like a traditional credit card. With VCCs, you may start making transactions anytime you require. 3. Transaction limit You might think that a transaction limit is a disadvantage; however, it lowers the possibility of fraudulent transactions. In addition, the transaction limit works exactly like a conventional credit card, ensuring there is no added complication. Also, the credit limit of the virtual card stays the same as your primary credit card. 4. Instant application Applying for a VCC is a quick process. You may use your laptop or smartphone to apply for the virtual number online from the comfort of your home. Your card company then issues the VCC, allowing you to start making digital transactions instantly. VCCs also come with the facility of instant online blocking. So, you can discontinue the virtual card immediately if there is any security concern. This option provides you more control while making the process safer. 5. The CVV does not change The Card Code Verification (CCV) number of the virtual card stays the same throughout the entire time it is active. Therefore, you can make as many transactions as you need using the same CVV. The number changes only if you cancel the virtual card and get a new one. How to Use Virtual Credit Card? Once you generate a virtual credit card, you can use it online at any time. You should keep in mind that it is not possible to swipe VCCs to make purchases like a regular credit card. You must follow the below steps to use the virtual card. Input the VCC number Enter the required validity information Use the OTP received on your phone to verify the transaction request Complete the transaction process Why Should You Apply for Virtual Credit Card? Other than security, there are multiple different reasons why you must apply for a virtual credit card and take advantag",

    "question": "The Evolution Of Banking in India",
    "answer": "Investment Strategies For BeginnersJuly 27, 2022Cost of Living in HyderabadAugust 22, 2022 evolution-of-banking-in-india Table of Contents Toggle The Indian banking system consists of commercial banks, which may be public scheduled or non-scheduled, private, regional, rural and cooperative banks. The banking system in India defines banking through the Banking Companies Act of 1949. In this post, we take a look at the evolution of banking in India, the different categories and the impact of nationalised banks. Phase 1: The Pre-Independence Phase (1770 to 1969) There were almost 600 banks present in India before independence. The first bank to be established the Bank of Hindustan was founded in 1770 in Calcutta. It closed down in 1832. The Oudh Commercial Bank was India‚Äôs first commercial bank in the history of the evolution of banking in India. A few other banks that were established in the 19th century, such as Allahabad Bank (Est. 1865) and Punjab National Bank (Est. 1894), have survived the test of time and exist even today. Some other banks like the Bank of Bengal, Bank of Madras, and Bank of Bombay ‚Äì established in the early to mid-1800s ‚Äì were merged as one to become the Imperial Bank, which later became the State Bank of India. Phase 2: The Post-Independence Phase (1969 to 1991) After independence, the evolution of the banking system in India continued pretty much the same as before. In 1969, the Government of India decided to nationalise the banks under the Banking Regulation Act of 1949. A total of 14 banks were nationalised, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In 1975, the Government of India recognised that several groups were financially excluded. Between 1982 and 1990, it created banking institutions with specialised functions in line with the evolution of financial services in India. NABARD (1982) ‚Äì to support agricultural activities EXIM (1982) ‚Äì to promote export and import National Housing Board ‚Äì to finance housing projects SIDBI ‚Äì to fund small-scale industries Phase 3: The LPG Era (1991 Till Date) From 1991 onwards, there was a sea change in the Indian economy. The government invited private investors to invest in India. Ten private banks were approved by the RBI. A few prominent names which exist even today from this liberalisation are HDFC, Axis Bank, ICICI, DCB and IndusInd Bank. In the early to mid-2000s, two other banks, Kotak Mahindra Bank (2001) and Yes Bank (2004), received their licenses. IDFC and Bandhan banks were also given licenses in 2013-14. Other notable changes and developments during this era were: Foreign banks like Citibank, HSBC and Bank of America set up branches in India. The nationalisation of banks came to a standstill. RBI and the government treated public and private sector banks equally. Payments banks came into existence. Small finance banks were permitted to set up their branches throughout India. Banks began to digitalise transactions and various other related banking operations. Reasons Why Banks Were Nationalised in India To get a clearer picture of the impact of nationalisation on the banking industry and the general population, let‚Äôs understand why the government decided to nationalise banks: To Energise Priority Sectors: Banks were collapsing at a fast rate ‚Äì 361 banks failed between 1947 and 1955, which converts to about 40 banks a year! Customers lost their deposits with no chance of recovering them. A Neglected Agricultural Sector: Banks favoured large industries and businesses and neglected the rural sector. Nationalisation came with a pledge to support the agricultural sector. Expansion of Branches: Nationalisation facilitated the opening of new branches to ensure maximum coverage of banks throughout the country. Mobilisation of Savings: Nationalising the banks would allow people more access to banks and encourage them to save, injecting additional revenue into a cash-strapped economy. Economic and Political Factors: The two wars in 1962 and 1965 put a tremendous burden on the economy. The nationalisation of Indian banks would give the economy a boost through increased deposits. The Positive Effects of Nationalisation The nationalisation of Indian banks was one of the most significant events in the evolution of banks in India. Today, India has 19 nationalised banks. Here are a few ways that nationalisation benefited the economy: Increased Savings: There was a sharp increase in savings with the opening of new branches. As national income rose in the 19",

    "question": "What is Digital Lending & How Digital Lending Is Changing India",
    "answer": "Personal Loan Insurance: Should You Get It?November 28, 2024What is Retail Loan?: its Meaning, Types, BenefitsNovember 28, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle In a technologically driven world, traditional means of obtaining money are drastically altered. Digital lending has emerged as a critical factor in the financial landscape, transforming the way individuals and businesses get loans. Now, you can acquire financial assistance with a few clicks, without the time-consuming paperwork and long wait times that traditional banks need. Sounds tempting, doesn‚Äôt it? However, understanding the complexities, benefits, and processes of digital financing is critical for both individual consumers and businesses. Let‚Äôs look at the new realm of digital lending and how it‚Äôs reshaping your financial connections. What is Digital Lending? Digital lending is the online method of borrowing and lending money. Unlike traditional banking processes, digital lenders can approve and issue loans quickly, typically within hours, thanks to smart algorithms and data analytics. However, this landscape must be navigated with caution. Consumer awareness is critical in this arena, ensuring that you are entirely informed about the terms and circumstances. How Digital Lending is Changing India Digital lending is revolutionising the Indian financial landscape, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. By leveraging technology, lenders can reach a wider audience, including small businesses and individuals in rural areas. This increased accessibility is empowering millions of Indians to achieve their financial goals. Moreover, digital lending platforms are streamlining the loan application and approval process, reducing the time it takes to secure funds. This efficiency is particularly beneficial for businesses that need quick capital to seize opportunities or overcome challenges. Additionally, digital lenders often offer flexible repayment terms and lower interest rates compared to traditional lenders, making it more affordable for borrowers. As digital lending continues to grow in India, it is crucial to maintain a balance between innovation and regulation. Strict regulations are necessary to protect consumers from predatory lending practices and ensure transparency. By promoting responsible lending and financial literacy, India can harness the power of digital lending to drive economic growth and financial inclusion. Benefits of Digital Lending Digital lending is not a fad, as many people speculate. It offers significant benefits that appeal to both borrowers and lenders, so it‚Äôs here to stay! Check out some of its top advantages:- Optimise the Loan Cycle If you opt for digital financing, you can complete the whole lending procedure much faster than traditional banks. The technology guarantees that you get the money when you need it the most. Compliance With Rules and Regulations While it may appear that technology is a risk to regulatory compliance, digital platforms can incorporate compliance checks into their systems to ensure that they follow both local and international rules. This built-in control reduces the possibility of infractions, giving you much-needed peace of mind. Customer Experience The digital banking experience goes beyond traditional interactions. Many systems have user-friendly interfaces that facilitate navigation and application submission, resulting in increased client satisfaction. Who would not prefer the ease and effectiveness of applying for loans online over time-consuming in-person visits to financial institutions? Minimal Documentation The days of document hoarding are over. Digital lenders frequently expedite the documentation process by using technology to obtain relevant information directly. Usually, you simply need to furnish your digital identity and bank statements rather than mountains of paper. Cost Efficiency Digital financial institutions operate without physical branches, resulting in cheaper overhead costs. This results in better pricing and conditions for borrowers. Ultimately, lower operating costs benefit both borrowers and lenders Steps to a Smooth Digital Lending Process Here‚Äôs a look at your easy digital lending journey, which unfolds across six key steps: Step 1: Loan Origination The digital financing process begins with loan origination, which is the first interaction between you and the platform. You can select the loan type, amount, and term before opening an account. ",

    "question": "What is Gold ETF ‚Äì Overview, Advantages, Disadvantages & How to Invest",
    "answer": "Large Cap Funds ‚Äì Meaning, Features, Advantages and DisadvantagesSeptember 30, 2022A Comprehensive Overview to Investing in Sectoral Mutual FundsOctober 3, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle A Gold Exchange-traded fund is a novel way to invest in gold without buying physical gold. Gold ETF allows investors to buy or sell gold on an exchange. Essentially what is a gold ETF is investing in the yellow metal through an exchange. Each unit of the gold ETF scheme represents1 gram of gold of the highest purity, and the unit‚Äôs price tracks the price of the gold. So the amount of investment in gold ETF means investment in the corresponding weight of gold. Are you still wondering what is gold ETF? Well, it is a passive investment based on gold that invests in physical gold and supports gold prices. In other words, gold ETFs are units that represent physical gold, and one can trade them on an exchange like any company‚Äôs stock. One unit of gold ETF represents 1 gram of gold and is backed by actual gold of the highest purity (99.5 parts) The first gold ETF was launched in India in 2007, and now almost all asset management companies have their own gold ETFs. Traditionally, gold has been an investor favourite both in India and internationally. Gold is considered a store of value and hedge against inflation, and the investment in ETF conserves these properties, in addition to the convenience of holding the precious metal in electronic form. Why Should You Invest in Gold ETFs? Investing in a gold ETF will diversify your portfolio, providing you with the benefits of investing in a different asset class, i.e., gold. In addition, it will come under passive investment and can constitute a defensive portion of your portfolio. Additionally, investment in gold is considered a hedge against inflation and sudden market fluctuations. The same holds for gold ETFs also. Investors negatively correlate the price of gold with significant currencies like the US dollar, and a fall in the US dollar can increase gold prices. Therefore, investors can hedge their exposure to the US dollar by investing in gold. Each unit of gold ETFs represents one gram of gold of the highest purity (99.5% pure). The fact makes it suitable for long-term investment, whether the investor is looking for a one-time lumpsum investment or making smaller periodic investments. Advantages of Investing in a Gold ETF a. Purity: Purity can be considered a given factor. Each unit of gold ETF represents 1 gm of gold of the highest priority. b. Convenience: As opposed to physical gold, here you would be holding the gold in dematerialized form. Keeping gold in electronic form saves a lot of hassle of storage, like security and handling. c. Ease of trading: You can buy or sell gold ETF units from your Demat account at the click of a button. Gold ETFs are much easier to liquidate in the market. d. No loads: There are no entry or exit loads in the gold ETFs. It means there is no deduction of any amount from your investment at the time of investment or during withdrawal. e. Tax benefits: Long-term investments in gold mutual funds are taxed at 20% after indexation. The long-term implies investment for more than three years. f. Pledging: One can pledge gold ETF units as collaterals for obtaining loans. Should You Invest in Gold ETF One can say that Gold ETFs are suitable for investors looking to take advantage of the long-term appreciation in gold prices. Investment in gold ETF means investment in gold in its purest form. In addition, gold ETFs are ideal for investors who do not want to invest in physical commodity gold. Gold ETFs still allow them to take advantage of rising gold prices by trading it on the exchange. Gold ETFs provide the opportunity to gain market exposure to the price and performance of the precious metal. Gold-based exchange-traded funds have given good returns in the last few years. This fact makes them a perfect investment option for conservative investors looking to invest for the long term. The expenses in gold ETFs are in the form of brokerage up to 0.5 to 1%, making them a cheaper investment option than other mutual fund schemes. It is advisable to keep the investment in Gold ETF limited to 5-10% of your portfolio to maintain the balance of risk and return in your portfolio. How to Invest in Gold ETFs Investing in gold ETF is relatively simple; you must have a Demat and trading account with a broker. One can open Demat and trading accounts by providing essential KYC docume",

    "question": "How Credit Card EMI Works?",
    "answer": "How to Apply for Self Employed Credit Card: 7 Best Credit Card OptionsJanuary 16, 2024Advantages & Disadvantages of Credit Card Investments ‚Äì Jupiter MoneyJanuary 18, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle How Credit Card EMI Works? Credit cards are one of the most important financial tools in the market. They offer multiple benefits, from providing money in emergencies to offering great rewards, cashback, and an interest-free period to repay your debt. Along with these, credit cards also allow you to repay your debt in small instalments that fit into your budget. This is called credit card EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments). Let‚Äôs explore what credit card EMI is and how it works. What is Credit Card EMI? When you can‚Äôt repay your credit card dues on time, you can break them down into smaller instalments and repay them over a certain period of time. This feature is called credit card EMI and works well in case of big-ticket purchases or when you usually only pay the minimum balance of your credit card dues. Through credit card EMI, you can split a big amount into small, affordable EMIs for a tenure ranging from 3-24 months. Banks usually allow credit card users to convert any amount above Rs. 10,000 into smaller instalments. How Credit Card EMI Works? When you shop with a credit card, you might see the option to pay in easy monthly instalments (EMIs) instead of paying the full amount at once. But how does that really work? Let‚Äôs break it down. Interest Rates When you choose to pay via EMI, the Credit Card company charges interest on the amount you owe. The rate can vary depending on your card and the offer. Generally, the longer the EMI period, the higher the interest rate. Tenure Options Credit Card EMIs usually offer different repayment periods, ranging from 3 months to a year or more. The longer the tenure, the smaller your monthly payments will be, but the more interest you‚Äôll end up paying. Conversion Process To convert a purchase into EMI, you typically need to request it with your card issuer, either through their website, mobile app, or by calling customer service. Some credit cards also let you convert purchases into EMIs automatically after a certain amount. Once the request is processed, the purchase amount is broken down into instalments. EMI Billing and Payment Each month, your credit card statement will show the EMI amount due, along with the interest. You‚Äôll pay this along with your regular credit card payments. Missing an EMI payment might lead to late fees, so make sure to pay on time to avoid extra charges. Interest Calculation The interest on your EMI is typically calculated on the total purchase amount, not just the remaining balance. This means that the interest can add up as you continue making monthly payments. Some cards may offer zero-interest EMIs for certain purchases, so it‚Äôs always worth asking about any special offers. How to Convert Credit Card Payments into EMI? If you want to spread out your Credit Card payments into easy monthly instalments (EMIs), the process is simpler than you might think. Here‚Äôs how you can do it: Check Your Eligibility Before you start, make sure you‚Äôre eligible for the EMI conversion. Some credit card companies might have certain conditions, like a minimum amount for the transaction or a specific credit score. Choose Your EMI Tenure Next, decide how long you want to pay off the amount. The EMI tenure could range from a few months to a couple of years, depending on what suits your budget. Select the EMI Option Your credit card provider will offer different EMI options, like low-interest plans or no-cost EMIs. Pick the one that works best for you. Verify Terms and Conditions Before confirming, take a moment to go through the terms and conditions. Look out for any hidden charges or interest rates that might apply. Confirm the Conversion If everything looks good, confirm the conversion and your monthly payments will be set up. Now you can pay in instalments, making it easier to manage larger purchases without stressing your budget. Advantages of Converting Credit Card Bills into EMI The following are the advantages of converting your credit card bill into EMI. 1. Lower interest than credit card When you fail to pay your credit card dues in full, banks usually charge around 36%-48% interest rate per annum, which comes to 3%-4% a month. However, if you opt for credit card EMI, banks charge you 1%-1.5% a month or 12%-18% per annum, which is almost half the cost of the former. 2",

    "question": "How Many Credit Cards Are Too Many?",
    "answer": "Can You Pay Your Taxes with a Credit Card: Benefits, Process, and MoreSeptember 9, 2024What is Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund (Balanced Advantage Mutual Fund)?September 9, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Credit cards offer a practical way to manage your finances, build your credit, and expand your purchasing options. However, the question of how many credit cards you should have isn‚Äôt as simple as it might seem. While having several cards can bring perks like more rewards and better credit utilization, it also carries risks that could impact your financial health. Let‚Äôs break down the benefits and potential pitfalls of holding multiple credit cards and figure out how to find the right balance for your needs. How Many Credit Cards Can You Have? In India, there‚Äôs no hard limit on how many credit cards you can own. It‚Äôs about what you‚Äôre eligible for and what fits your financial needs. Whether you prefer the simplicity of one card or see the appeal in managing several, the choice is yours. However, with more cards comes more responsibility, such as staying on top of payment dates, managing varied interest rates, and ensuring you don‚Äôt overextend yourself. While the perks are real, understanding your spending habits and financial goals is important for deciding how many cards make sense for you. Balancing the benefits of multiple cards with the discipline they require can be the difference between financial freedom and financial stress. Advantages of Having Many Credit Cards 01 Increased Spending Capacity Having a few credit cards can significantly broaden your spending options. Each card adds its own credit limit to your overall pool, so when one card‚Äôs limit falls short for a major expense, you have other cards to fall back on. This way, you can manage larger purchases with ease and avoid potential hiccups if one card reaches its limit. 02 Improved Credit Score Multiple credit cards, if handled with care, can be a boon for your credit score. Your credit score hinges on factors like payment history and how much of your credit you‚Äôre using at any given time. By spreading your expenses across several cards and keeping up with payments, you help lower your credit utilization ratio. This smart management can lead to a healthier credit score. 03 Rewards and Offers The appeal of credit cards often lies in the rewards and perks they offer. Many people go for multiple cards to tap into a range of rewards programs, cashback deals, and special discounts. By using different cards for specific types of spending- like one for travel, another for dining, and yet another for shopping‚Äì you can make the most of each card‚Äôs benefits. Over time, this strategic approach can lead to impressive savings and a treasure of rewards. Disadvantages of Having Many Credit Cards 01 Potential Debt Trap Holding multiple credit cards can open the door to a potential debt spiral. With each card offering its own credit limit, it‚Äôs tempting to spend beyond your means. If you‚Äôre not careful, you might find yourself maxing out several cards, leading to a mess of debt that‚Äôs hard to manage and even harder to pay off. 02 Higher Overall Charges Another downside of having many credit cards is dealing with a lot of fees. Each card has its own set of charges, such as annual fees, interest rates, and late payment penalties. If you‚Äôre not keeping a close eye on these, the fees can quickly add up and overshadow any perks you might get from having a number of cards. Points to Remember While Assessing Your Need for Multiple Credit Cards Do You Really Need Another Card? Before applying for another credit card, take a moment to ask yourself if you really need it. Reflect on your financial goals. A new card should fit into your plan, not just clutter your wallet. Beware of Lure of Intro Offers Introductory offers, like bonus points, cashback, or waived fees can be tempting, but they‚Äôre often short-lived. These flashy perks should not be the sole reason for adding a new card to your collection. Look for cards that offer lasting value beyond the initial enticements. Check Your Credit Score Your credit score is your ticket to new credit cards, so it‚Äôs smart to check it before applying. A strong credit score not only improves your chances of getting approved but also helps you get better terms and rewards on your new card. Can You Handle the Payments? Managing multiple credit cards means keeping up with more payments. Before you take on more cards, make sure you can handle the a",

    "question": "Mutual Fund Diversification: Meaning, How it Works, and Advantages",
    "answer": "Portfolio Diversification: Types, Strategies, Benefits & LimitationJune 27, 2023Fundamental Analysis vs Technical Analysis: Meaning and Key DifferencesJune 27, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Diversification is a risk management technique that you can use to reduce the risk of investing. In diversification, you spread your investment across different securities, asset classes, and industries. The primary idea behind this is to negate the downside risk of one security with another so the overall portfolio returns are maintained. So, a diversified portfolio will include different asset classes such as equity, debt, government securities, commodities, or currency. However, it is also important to diversify within an asset class. If you decide to invest in mutual funds, you must ensure that your mutual fund portfolio is diversified. What is mutual fund diversification? Diversification in mutual funds means spreading out your investments to lower the chances of losing money. It‚Äôs like not putting all your eggs in one basket to reduce risks. Investing in mutual funds to build wealth is an excellent idea. This is because equity mutual funds have the potential to give high returns in the long term. Moreover, mutual funds invest in several companies, which automatically ensures diversification. Another advantage of investing in mutual funds is that they spare you the effort of picking individual stocks. However, investing in just one mutual fund doesn‚Äôt mean your portfolio is diversified. Imagine if that one mutual fund you invested in started giving losses; all your hard-earned money would vanish right in front of you. Hence it is important to diversify your mutual fund portfolio as well. How does diversification work in mutual funds? There is always a risk of underperformance when it comes to investing. Since mutual funds invest in marketable securities and are managed by fund managers who base their decisions on research and assumptions, there is a higher risk of a fund underperforming when compared to the market of other funds. Hence it is important that you spread your investment across multiple mutual funds, so you can reduce the downside risk and maintain the overall portfolio return. When you invest in multiple mutual funds with different portfolios, and time horizons, the loss in one mutual fund can be nullified with the profit from another mutual fund. However, for this to work, it is important to invest in mutual funds that are not correlated. This means you must invest in mutual funds spread across different industries, geographies, and time horizons. For example, if you invested in a fund which is the majority of the exposure to travel companies, then in times when inflation is high, the profit margins of these companies might contract, affecting the performance of the fund. If you invested in a fund with major exposure to commodities, then the profit from this fund can negate the loss of the first fund. Hence with mutual fund diversification, you can reduce the downside risk and maintain your portfolio returns, which ultimately will help accumulate wealth in the long run. How to diversify your mutual fund portfolio? To have a diversified mutual fund portfolio, you must carefully choose funds with exposure to diverse securities. The following points will guide you in diversifying your mutual fund portfolio. Diversify across different schemes Mutual funds are broadly categorized into equity, debt, and hybrid mutual funds, and each of these categories has different types under them. For example, equity funds are divided into large cap, mid cap, small cap, value funds, and thematic funds. Debt funds are divided into liquid, ultra-short-term, credit-risk, and long-duration funds. Finally, hybrid funds are divided into aggressive, conservative, and balanced funds. Investing across several types of mutual funds will ensure your portfolio is well diversified. Diversify across time horizons Invest in mutual funds with different time horizons. Equity funds, by default, are a long-term investment option and suit a horizon of more than five years. Debt mutual funds, on the other hand, are suitable for shorter horizons. You can use hybrid funds for a duration of three to five years. So, spreading your investment across different time horizons will reduce the impact of market volatility on your portfolio. Diversify across different fund managers and fund houses Mutual funds are managed by fund managers who are professionals wit",

    "question": "Debt Explained: Types, Benefits, and How It Works Explained",
    "answer": "What Is Automated Teller Machine (ATM) And How Does It Work?July 27, 2022What is the Time Value of Money (TMV) and Why is it Important?July 27, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Going back to our childhood every one of us had borrowed something from our friends like a pen, paper, etc. After growing up, we have responsibilities on our shoulders. Sometimes our earnings are not enough to achieve our long term goals just because of this web of loan and debt. Debt is a loan taken out from one party to another, usually to finance large purchases that would otherwise be unaffordable. This type of loan is used for all kinds of purchases by corporations and individuals. Debt arrangements allow the borrower to borrow money under the condition that it will be repaid at a later date with interest. A person can create a debt management plan to get their debt under control with the help of financial planning and budget. What is Debt? Loans are the most common forms of debt, these include mortgages, auto loans, personal loans, and credit card debt. Loans must be repaid by an agreed date after the borrower takes out the loan. Furthermore, the loan agreement states the amount of interest that the borrower must pay on a yearly basis, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. Borrowers are encouraged to repay the loans quickly to reduce their interest expenses by charging interest to ensure that the lender is compensated for taking on that risk. Individuals and households commonly borrow money to cover monthly expenses such as mortgage loans, car loans, credit card debt, income taxes, and credit card payments. For individuals, debt allows them to use an anticipated income combined with future purchasing power before they earn it. Similarly, corporations have a wide range of options when it comes to debt. Debt can be short-term or long-term. Companies may use debt to fund their daily operations or for working capital. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates the banking sector, which facilitates loans, acts as a lender, and acts as a facilitator. How Debt Works? Some people borrow money so they can use their cash elsewhere, such as making purchases they cannot afford to pay cash for. In addition, some people borrow money so they can make a purchase that they cannot afford to pay cash for. Unlike conventional loans, these types of debt do not go directly to the borrower, but rather to the person or organisation that provided the goods or services. For instance, the mortgage lender receives the funds from the seller. When an individual (or organisation, business, or government) becomes overly indebted due to their income and expenses, they may have to file for bankruptcy in order to get relief from their debts. The bankruptcy court can discharge someone‚Äôs debts so creditors no longer have to request payment. A bankruptcy court discharge allows the debtor to be released from certain obligations. Types of Debts There are a few types of debts given below. This helps us understand the debts more precisely: 1. Secured Debt Mortgages, auto loans, and secured credit cards are examples of secured debt. In the event of default, a lender can take your collateral. In case the loan is delinquent for a certain period of time, the lender can repossess the property for repayment. It consists of debt which is backed by collateral, a lien which the lender has on the collateral. It provides the lender with additional security when lending money out. 2. Unsecured Debt Credit cards, student loans, medical bills, payday loans, and student loans are all unsecured debt types and do not attach collateral to the loan. If you default on the loan, your property won‚Äôt usually be taken. A third-party collection agency will typically purchase delinquent debts from creditors rather than repossessing your property if you do not repay unsecured debt. In addition to calling you and sending letters to get payment, debt collectors often add debt entry to your credit record, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, they may sue you or ask the court to garnish your wages. 3. Revolving Debt The repayment schedule for revolving debt is flexible. The credit line can be accessed as long as you‚Äôre paying minimum monthly payments toward one or more outstanding balances. It is commonly associated with credit card debt, in which the card issuer offers the borrower a credit line as long as they meet their debt obligations with the card issuer. As long as the borrower meets the debt obligations, the",

    "question": "Explained: Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility With Diagram",
    "answer": "Best Bank For Salary Account In IndiaApril 2, 2025Best Money Transfer Apps in India (With Play Store Ratings) ‚Äì Top 25 AppsApril 7, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle What is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU)? The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility states that as a person consumes more of a good or service, the additional satisfaction (or utility) they derive from each additional unit decreases. In simpler terms, the more of something you have, the less you value each additional unit. For example, the first slice of pizza might be incredibly satisfying, but as you eat more slices, your enjoyment of each additional slice gradually decreases. For example, you have a packet of candies from which you consume three candies, which may delight your taste buds. However, after consuming nine to ten pieces, it may not be as delightful as the first three pieces consumed at the beginning Mathematical Explanation of the Law of Marginal Utility Marginal Utility (MU) is the additional satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good. Formula: MU = ‚àÜTU ‚àÜQ MU = Marginal Utility ŒîTU = Change in Total Utility ŒîQ = Change in Quantity Consumed Importance of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU) Human wants are based on a characteristic of intensity. As we consume more of a commodity in succession, marginal utility from consumption of each additional unit of the commodity decreases. Below mentioned are some reasons that justify the importance of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility: Basis of economic law: This law is the basic law of economics, which displays commodity consumption among consumers. Several other economic laws, such as the Law of Equi-Marginal Utility and the Law of Demand, are based on the ‚ÄòLaw of Diminishing Marginal Utility.‚Äô Diversity in consumption and production: As consumers, we always tend to find new things more appealing after consuming one product for a very long time. Producers often change the packaging. Pattern and design of the product keeping this law in mind. Taxation: The principle of increasing taxation is also based on the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. The rate of taxes increases on a person‚Äôs income as their income increases because the marginal utility of money falls to the rise of income of the person. How Businesses use DMU law? This principle helps businesses decide how much of a product to be offered and at what price. When companies know that customers get less satisfaction with each extra unit consumption, they can plan discounts, bundle offers, or offer product variations to keep interest high. For example, fast food combos or ‚Äúbuy one get one‚Äù deals use this logic to keep customers happy while increasing sales. Assumptions of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility The Assumptions of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility are: Standard Size of Units: The law assumes that when consumers buy goods, they do so in standard amounts. This means they are consuming whole units, like eating an entire apple instead of just a slice. Continuous Consumption: It is expected that consumers will keep using the product without taking breaks. This means they are consuming one unit right after another without delays. Same Quality of Units: The law relies on the idea that all units of a product are the same in terms of quality. For instance, each apple a consumer eats should be similar in taste and size. Rational Consumer: This principle applies only if the consumer acts logically. It means they make careful decisions about what and how much to consume based on their preferences Stability of Preferences: The law assumes that a consumer‚Äôs tastes, likes, income, and habits do not change during the consumption process. This stability helps keep the law applicable. Measurable Utility: The law works on the idea that consumers can express their satisfaction in measurable terms, often referred to as ‚Äúutils.‚Äù This means they can quantify how much pleasure or satisfaction they get from consuming goods. Single Purpose Consumption: According to this law, a consumer uses a product to satisfy one specific need or desire at a time, rather than trying to meet multiple needs with the same item. Divisibility of Goods: This assumption means that the items can be split into smaller portions. This makes it easier and quicker for consumers to consume the goods, as they can take small amounts as needed. Constant Value of Money Utility: Finally, the law assumes that the satisfaction derived ",

    "answer": "Assets and Liabilities: What Are They? Know Difference between ThemAugust 24, 2024What is Liquidity? Financial Liquidity DefinitionAugust 27, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle The Aadhaar card is a necessary document that every Indian should possess. Whether you want to file your income tax returns, apply for a passport or open a new bank account, your Aadhaar card can come in handy. It is a government-approved photo identity proof that works across the country. Apart from the physical copy, you can also get a digitized version of your Aadhaar card. It is helpful in situations when you may not have access to the card or misplace it. As per the Aadhaar Act, this e-copy is just as valid as the hard copy. But if the thought of going through another process to access the digital version of your Aadhaar card is discomforting, here‚Äôs some good news. You only need an Aadhaar password to get the digital copy. Here‚Äôs all the necessary information about downloading your digital Aadhaar card. Password for e-Aadhaar This is the UIDAI format for Password of E-Aadhaar. The password combination is the first 4 letters of name in CAPITAL and the year of birth (YYYY). Common examples: Example 1 ‚Äì Name: RAHUL KHANNA Year of Birth: 2000 Password: RAHU2000 Example 2 ‚Äì Name: JAY KUMAR Year of Birth: 2000 Password: JAYK2000 Example 3 ‚Äì Name: S.KUMARAN Year of Birth: 2000 Password: S.KU2000 Example 4 ‚Äì Name: DIA Year of Birth: 2000 Password: DIA2000 Why do you need a password to access your Aadhaar card? Your Aadhaar card contains your Aadhaar number, which is a 12-digit unique identification number. This number uniquely identifies every individual, including children. It also holds your biometric and demographic information, which can be misused if it‚Äôs in the wrong hands.

If your name consists of only three letters, then the first letter of the surname is considered. For example, if the name on the Aadhaar card is Ria Sharma and the year of birth is 1990, the password is RIAS1990. If your name is R. Prakash and the year of birth is 1990, the password is R.PR1990.

    "answer": "HRA in Salary ‚Äì What is It? Calculations & FormulaSeptember 13, 2024Best 10+ Tax Saving Options Other Than Section 80CSeptember 24, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Paying the tax dues in advance over the financial year is better than leaving it for the last minute, which can be stressful. Calculating the tax liability and paying it is a cumbersome process and being regular with payments can help avoid the rush at the end of the financial year. When you pay the income tax in advance instead of paying a lump sum at the end of the year, it is known as an advance tax payment. It is a kind of ‚Äòpay tax as you earn‚Äô and the payments are made in instalments on or before the due dates as determined by the Income Tax Department. What is Advance Tax? As the name indicates, it refers to paying a part of your income tax liability before the end of the financial year. You may make an advance payment if your tax liability for a financial year exceeds INR 10,000. Generally, paying tax in advance is applicable if you earn income other than salary, which includes but is not limited to income from rent, capital gains, lottery winnings, fixed deposits, and much more. The tax should be paid in the same financial year during which the income is earned. How to calculate advance tax payment? To calculate the tax liability, you may follow these steps: Estimate the income from interest on fixed deposits, rent, capital gains, and business. Add your income from salary to determine gross taxable earnings. Calculate the income tax liability based on your relevant income tax slab rate. Deduct any applicable tax deducted at source (TDS) or the amount that is already deducted. If the tax liability based on the above calculation exceeds INR 10,000, you need to pay the tax in advance. Advance Tax Installment = (Estimated Total Tax Liability) / 4 Steps to Calculate Advance Tax: Estimate Your Total Income: Add up all your income sources for the financial year. Deduct Allowable Expenses: Subtract any eligible deductions from your total income. Calculate Taxable Income: Determine your taxable income by subtracting exemptions from your adjusted total income. Apply Tax Rates: Use the applicable tax slabs to calculate the tax payable on your taxable income. Consider Surcharges and Cess: Add any surcharges or cess levied on your tax amount. Estimate Total Tax Liability: Determine your estimated total tax liability for the financial year. Calculate Installments: Divide your estimated total tax liability by 4 to get the amount for each installment. Example: If your estimated total tax liability for the financial year is ‚Çπ50,000, then each advance tax installment would be: Advance Tax Installment = ‚Çπ50,000 / 4 = ‚Çπ12,500 Note, this is a very simplistic way of calculating advance tax. Do check appropriate calculations, provisions, and applicable deductions. Alternatively, you can use an online calculator to determine the advance income tax amount. To calculate the estimated tax liability, input your details, such as name, residential status, taxable income, age, TDS on salary, and financial year for which you are making the advance payment. Based on this information, the online calculator will provide the tax liability for the given financial year. Who is liable to pay advance tax? Business owners, salaried individuals, and freelancers If your income tax liability for a financial year is INR 10,000 or more, you are liable to pay advance income tax. However, if you are older than 60 years and do not have any business income, you are exempt from paying tax in advance. Presumptive income for professionals Professionals like lawyers, medical practitioners, architects, and others come under the presumptive scheme under Section 44ADA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. You need to pay the tax in advance as a single instalment on or before 15th March. Alternatively, you may pay the income tax before 31st March of the financial year. Presumptive income for businesses If you have opted for the presumptive tax scheme under section 44AD of the Income Tax Act, 1961, you must pay the entire tax in advance on or before 15th March. You can also pay the total tax liability before 31st March of the financial year. Advance tax payment due dates and payable amount The due dates to pay advance tax if you are self-employed or a businessperson are as follows: Due date Amount payable On or before 15th June Minimum 15% of the amount payable as tax in advance On or before 15th September Minimum 45",

What Is Credit Card Limit? Every credit card company and bank sets a purchase restriction on their credit cards. Simply put, a credit limit means the highest amount you are allowed to spend using a credit card.

The key aspects that determine your credit limit are as follows: Age Income Credit history Financial liabilities Credit score In addition, if you are getting your first credit card, the financial institution will possibly set a low credit limit on the card.

    "answer": "How to Save Income Tax on Salary? Tips to Save Money on TaxJuly 10, 2023‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§°‡§ø‡§ü ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§° ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à (Kisan Credit Card in Hindi)July 25, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Every company either uses its own money or outsiders‚Äô money to fund its operations. The own funds are usually known as shareholder‚Äôs capital, whereas the outsiders‚Äô money is known as debt or borrowed capital. Within shareholder‚Äôs capital, there are two different types known as equity and preference capital. Although both are quite similar, they differ in terms of dividend payment and voting rights. This article explains the key difference between equity share and preference share. What Are Equity Shares? Equity shares, also known as ordinary shares, are issued by companies by diluting their ownership. So, if you own equity shares of a company, you are part owner of it. Equity shareholders have voting rights, which means they get to participate in the important decisions of the company. Moreover, they are also entitled to get a share in profits through dividends. The company pays dividends to equity shareholders every year. However, the amount of dividends varies based on the profit the company earns. The higher the profit, the higher would be the dividend. However, you will not receive the entire profit. You are only entitled to receive the surplus after the company pays off all its responsibilities, such as preference dividends. Equity shares are non-redeemable, which means the company will not buy them back after a certain period of time. Hence they act as a source of long-term capital for the company. However, when the company is winding down its operations, equity shareholders are entitled to receive the surplus and also have a claim on the assets. You can trade in equity shares through the stock exchange and hold them in your demat account. Apart from receiving dividends, you will also benefit from capital appreciation, which is an increase in the price of the share over a period of time. Apart from being a great source of long-term wealth, equity shares also help in acquiring credit. Both company and shareholders can take a loan against the shares of the company to fund the deficit. Types of Equity Shares Equity shares are categorised into several types, and the following are some of them. Authorised share capital: It is the maximum amount of share capital a company can use. The authorised share capital can be altered from time to time by amending the memorandum of association (MoA) of the company. Issued share capital: The company doesn‚Äôt issue the entire shares to the public. It only issues part of it, which is known as issued share capital. The rest is held by the promoters of the company. Subscribed share capital: Subscribed share capital is a subset of issues share capital. It is part of the issued capital, which is subscribed by the shareholders. Paid-up capital: It is part of the subscribed share capital, which is paid by the shareholders. Sweat equity shares: Equity shares issued to compensate the efforts of employees or directors for their hard work are sweat equity shares. Bonus shares: A company pays dividends in the form of cash or shares. Shares which a company issues to its shareholders in the form of dividends are bonus shares. Rights shares: Shares that have certain rights attached to them are rights shares. These are issued by the company to safeguard the interest of existing shareholders. What Are Preference Shares? A preference share is a type of stock that grants the holder a fixed dividend, ensuring that they receive their dividend payments before ordinary shareholders. The priority of dividend payments for preference shareholders takes precedence over the distribution of dividends to common shareholders. However, they do not get voting rights and hence cannot participate in the company‚Äôs decisions. Preference shareholders are entitled to a fixed dividend every year. Even if a company makes less profit, they have to pay the preference shareholders a fixed premium. However, if a company loses, it need not pay a dividend. If a company makes a profit and doesn‚Äôt pay a dividend in a year, it must pay the preference shareholders their dividend later during the year. During liquidation, preference shareholders have a right to the assets after the creditors of the company are paid off. Hence this puts them second in the ranks of preference after creditors but before equity shareholders. But they do not get voting rights like equity s",

    "question": "What is Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund (Balanced Advantage Mutual Fund)?",
    "answer": "How Many Credit Cards Are Too Many?September 9, 2024Personal Finance: Guide for Beginners and Experienced AdultsSeptember 11, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle What are Dynamic Asset Allocation Mutual Funds? Dynamic asset allocation mutual funds are a type of hybrid funds that invest across multiple asset classes such as equity, debt securities, real estate, etc. They strike a balance between risk and return by balancing the portfolio. Hence there are also called balanced advantage funds. When the valuations are high, they reduce their equity exposure and increase the allocation to other asset classes, such as debt, to reduce the risk. In contrast, when the valuations are low, they invest more in equities to increase the return. These funds are professionally managed by experienced fund managers who make asset allocation decisions based on quantitative and qualitative analysis, not emotional bias. Since these funds are dynamically balanced, there is no target asset allocation, giving the fund managers the flexibility to rebalance the portfolio. Dynamic asset allocation funds best suit investors with long-term goals and have a medium to low-risk appetite. Although the success of these funds, like any other mutual fund, depends on the market conditions, it also depends on the fund manager‚Äôs ability. Purpose of Dynamic Asset Allocation Funds Balanced advantage funds are one of the best investment alternatives when markets are uncertain. Since there is no static asset allocation target, the flexibility of choosing the asset allocation based on the market conditions makes them suitable for all kinds of market conditions. If you want to dodge the effect of market slumps on your portfolio, dynamic asset allocation funds are your go-to funds. With minimum investment, you can get access to various asset classes, which will help you easily diversify your portfolio. Who Should Invest in Dynamic Asset Allocation Funds? Dynamic asset allocation funds are hybrid funds that invest in equity and debt instruments. Their asset allocation varies based on market conditions, and hence they manage risk very well. Investors with moderate to conservative risk tolerance levels can consider investing in them. Since these funds have exposure to equity, investors with long-term goals can also consider investing in them. Moreover, investors looking for diversification can also invest in them as they invest in multiple asset classes. Advantages of Dynamic Asset Allocation Funds Low risk: Dynamic asset allocation funds can resist bearish market conditions as they invest in multiple asset classes. Since their exposure to equity is lower than pure equity funds, the fall in the returns isn‚Äôt drastic making them suitable for low-risk investors. Diversification: These funds invest in multiple asset classes, making them ideal for retail investors looking for a diversified portfolio. With a low minimum investment, these funds can give exposure to equity and debt. Stable returns: Even though they invest in equity, balanced advantage funds give more dependable returns than other mutual fund categories. With low risk, investors can expect predictable returns. Flexibility to fund managers: The fund managers have the flexibility to decide on the asset allocation and aren‚Äôt restricted by a statutory limit which is the case for most mutual funds. This flexibility allows them to make quick and profitable decisions. No fund manager bias: Although the fund manager has the flexibility to decide the asset allocation, these funds are not subject to any kind of bias. This is because their decision is purely based on market movements. Invest any time: The primary advantage of mutual funds is that the hassle of timing the market is eliminated. However, in the case of pure equity funds, some investors do think twice before investing in the case of a bearish market phase. In the case of dynamic asset allocation funds, you don‚Äôt have to think twice before investing in any market condition, as they are designed to fight volatility. Challenges of Dynamic Asset Allocation Funds High costs: Since the portfolio is frequently rebalanced based on market conditions, the transaction costs for these funds are slightly higher than others. This affects the profits of the fund as expenses are deducted before publishing the fund‚Äôs net asset value (NAV). Fund manager‚Äôs performance: The success of the funds depends on the fund manager‚Äôs expertise. These funds require a lot of research and act",

    "question": "What are Neobanks? Everything You Should Know",
    "answer": "ITR Filing Due Date FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25)August 1, 2024What is Credit Card? ‚Äì its Benefits, Working, Uses & TypesAugust 1, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Banks cater to all your financial requirements, such as savings account, deposits, credit cards, and much more. They deliver these services via a wide network of branches across the country. However, fintech companies and startups called neobanks now offer a more convenient and hassle-free way to meet these needs. What Is Neobank? Wondering what neobanking / neo banking is ‚Äî Well, it has globally taken over the fintech industry with new players emerging almost every day. These banks operate only online without any physical presence and offer a wide range of services like traditional banks. Neobanks are virtual banks and offer complete banking services via digital platforms like mobile applications. How Does Neobank Works? These banks may use one of the following three operating models. Traditional banks having their digital initiatives Non-licensed fintech companies collaborating with traditional banks to provide web or mobile interfaces for different products offered by the partner banks Licensed neobanks without any tie-up with traditional banks with a digital banking license Origin and History of Neobanks These banks originated when technology-based financial service companies challenged traditional banks. Some of the first players emerged in the United Kingdom and Germany. In India, Niyo Solutions was one of the first companies to emerge in this sector. The landscape of neobanking in India and across the globe The global market for such banks has seen exponential growth in its size and customer base. It is estimated that this sector will continue growing between 25% and 30% over the next few years. There are 10 neobanks in India with ICICI partnering with three players. However, these banks are presently not allowed to hold customer deposits and are also not granted virtual licenses by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It is expected that such banks will become mainstream players with more customers and small companies overcoming their fear and adapting to the changing environment of the banking sector. By 2024, it is projected that these new-age banks will have approximately 98 million users with 187 million accounts managing around $63 billion globally. Difference Between Digital Bank and Neobank Often, the terms neobanks and digital banks are used interchangeably; however, there is a difference between the two. The Neobank only has an online presence and may operate independently of traditional banks. On the other hand, digital banks are the online platforms of well-known traditional banks. Why You Should Try Neobank? Here are four reasons why you should opt for this new-age bank. Simple and friendly user interface (UI) With modern technologies, these banks deliver an enhanced user experience. The websites and applications are simple and responsive with almost no glitches to provide a superior experience. Easy account opening process Although opening an account with traditional banks is now simpler, you still need to fill out an application form and submit the documents at the nearest branch. In comparison, you may open an account with these new-age banks via your smartphone in just a few simple steps. Affordable As there are no physical branches, neobanks can significantly reduce their costs and overheads. You do not have to pay any annual maintenance charges or withdrawal fees. Beneficial for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) Generally, the application, approval, and disbursal procedures for MSMEs with traditional banks are long and cumbersome. However, fintech services simplify the entire procedure and reduce the efforts, making it advantageous for MSMEs. Neobank vs Traditional Bank For the last few decades, traditional banks have divided their businesses with various systems and processes acting as different entities. Moreover, they rely on a physical presence with a wide network of sales force, distribution channels, and branches to operate. On the other hand, neobanks work on scalable open platforms. These are based on technological platforms integrated with the traditional banks through an open Application Programming Interface (API), which makes them flexible and scalable. The table below shows the difference between both options. Traditional banks Neobanks Platform Physical branches and digital presence Only online presence Business type B",

    "question": "How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains on Debt Mutual Fund?",
    "answer": "Mutual Fund Penalty: Meaning, Consequences and How to Avoid It?December 12, 20225 Easy And Different Ways To Invest In Mutual Funds OnlineDecember 14, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Before investing in any financial instrument, the first thing we check is the returns. We are more concerned about the profit that we overlook the tax we have to pay. No one likes unpleasant surprises, and tax on returns can be one if you don‚Äôt know how much tax you have to pay on the profit you make. In mutual funds, equity and debt funds are taxed differently. This article will cover the calculation of long-term capital gain on debt mutual funds in detail. What are capital gains for debt mutual funds? Debt funds are mutual funds that invest in debt securities such as money market instruments, government bonds, and corporate bonds. They give predictable and stable returns and are best suited for investors with short-term goals and low-risk tolerance. The returns you earn on debt mutual funds can either be in the form of interest or capital appreciation. Interest is the fixed return, whereas capital appreciation is the increase in the value of the fund due to market dynamics. These are called capital gains, and based on how long you hold them, capital gains are categorized as short-term and long-term. Short-term capital gains are profits earned within three years from the date of investment. Long-term capital gains, on the other hand, are profits earned after three years from the date of investment. Both short-term and long-term gains are taxed differently. You will be liable to pay tax on capital gains only when you sell your mutual fund investment. How are capital gains taxed? Short-term capital gains are taxed as per your income tax slab rate. So, if you sell your debt mutual funds before 36 months from the date of investment, your capital gains will be added to your income and taxed accordingly. You will have to pay long-term capital gains if you sell the investment after 36 months. The long-term capital gains are taxed at 10% without indexation benefits and 20% with indexation benefits. The dividends distributed by the fund house are also taxable. They are taxable at the investor‚Äôs income tax slab rate. Moreover, dividends beyond Rs 5,00 are subject to a TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) of 10%. What is the indexation benefit? Indexation is adjusting the value of investments through a price index so that your purchasing power is maintained post-inflation. With indexation, you can also reduce your tax burden. You can inflate the purchase price so that the gap between your purchase and sale price is reduced, lowering your taxable returns and tax liability. Indexation applies to long-term investments. With indexation, you can reduce your long-term capital gains and pay less tax. In mutual funds, indexation applies only to debt mutual funds. To calculate the indexed cost of acquisition, you will have to adjust the original cost using the price index. The formula for calculating the indexed cost of acquisition is given below. Indexed cost of acquisition = Original cost * (CII of the year of sale/CII of year of purchase), Where, CII is the cost inflation index, and the data is readily available on the income tax website. Let‚Äôs see how indexation will help reduce capital gains with the help of an example. Calculation of long-term capital gains on debt mutual funds Assume you had invested Rs 150,000 in a debt fund when the NAV was Rs 20 in 2016 and sold it after four years in 2020 when the NAV is Rs 25. Let‚Äôs see how to calculate the capital gains with indexation benefit and tax liability. The number of units you will get is 7,500 (Rs 150000/20) The capital gain per unit is Rs 5 (Rs 25-20) , and the total gain is Rs 37,500. But since you have invested for more than three years, you are eligible for an indexation benefit. Though it is optional, it is best to take the indexation benefit, as this will reduce your tax burden. To get an indexation benefit, we must first calculate the indexed cost of acquisition. The CII for 2016 is 254, and for 2022 is 289. Indexed cost of acquisition = 20 * (289/254) Indexed cost of acquisition = Rs 22.76 The indexed long-term gain is Rs 2.24 (Rs 25-22.76), and the total gain now is Rs 16,830.7. These are taxable gains and will be taxed at 20%. Hence your tax liability is Rs 3,366. Should you go for the indexation benefit? Indexation benefit will help you reduce your taxable capital gains and hence your tax liability.",

    "question": "Large Cap Funds ‚Äì Meaning, Features, Advantages and Disadvantages",
    "answer": "Best Tax Saving Investment Options in IndiaSeptember 29, 2022What is Gold ETF ‚Äì Overview, Advantages, Disadvantages & How to InvestOctober 3, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle What is a Large Cap Fund? While speaking of mutual funds, one comes across the term large cap mutual funds. Some investors may be unaware of what is large-cap fund. A large cap mutual fund meaning implies equity funds that invest a larger percentage of their total assets in companies with high market capitalisation. Investing in large-cap mutual funds offers stable returns over the long term compared to mid-cap and small-cap funds. What is Large Cap Mutual Fund SEBI Regulation? As per Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations, large-cap funds have to mandatorily invest 80% of their assets in the equity shares of the top 100 high-market capitalisation companies. Market capitalisation or market cap refers to the market value of a company‚Äôs outstanding shares. High market capitalisation organisations have a strong market reputation and a proven track record of generating wealth for investors over the long run. Different types of Market Cap in Mutual Funds The different types of market caps in mutual funds are: Large Cap Meaning ‚Äì Market capitalisation of Rs. 20,000 crores or more Mid Cap Meaning ‚Äì Market capitalisation between Rs. 5,000 crores ‚Äì Rs. 20,000 crores Small Cap Meaning ‚Äì Market capitalisation below Rs. 5,000 crores. Who should invest in Large Cap Mutual Funds? Large-cap mutual funds are suitable for investors who require steady returns over the long term and have a low-risk appetite. Such investors look for stable capital increases through equities investment but do not want to take high investment risks. However, for investing in large cap funds, investors should have an investment horizon of at least 5- 7 years to get consistent returns. What is Large Cap Fund Taxability? The taxability of large cap funds is similar to other equity mutual funds. When a large cap is held for less than one year, they are taxable as short-term capital gains with a tax rate of 15%. If the large cap funds are held over 12 months, they are taxable as long-term capital gains of 10%. Also, yields up to Rs. 1 lakh on the sale of large cap mutual funds are completely exempt from tax. What is a Large Cap Risk Level? Investors prefer large cap funds as they provide stable returns and steady growth with moderate risk across equity funds compared to mid-cap and small-cap funds. For instance, during market volatility, large cap fund returns get impacted with a lower margin helping the funds maintain stability compared to other equity funds. So, a large cap fund‚Äôs Net Asset Value (NAV) fluctuates less aggressively compared to the benchmark of small caps and midcaps. What is a Large Cap Feature? Best large cap funds have features as stated below: Large cap funds or blue chip mutual funds are equity funds that predominantly invest in equities of blue-chip companies compared to other securities. A blue chip company has a good reputation and brand presence, with reliable and quality stocks. As a large-cap gets invested in blue-chip equities, they are easily traded. There is thus greater liquidity with large-cap funds owing to easy cash flow available on the regular sale and purchase of these equities. Large cap funds deliver stable and consistent returns over time. As there is consistent trading of blue chip company stocks, rapid fluctuations rarely happen in such stocks. There are no instant highs in stock prices, but the stocks do not plummet easily. So, the best blue chip fund would provide steady returns. Owing to their stable and steady nature, high liquidity and moderate large cap mutual fund meaning imply they are secured equity investments than mid-caps or small-caps. Advantages of Large Cap Mutual Funds The best large cap fund offers the below advantages. 1. Stable and Consistent Returns A large cap fund meaning implies that such funds offer stable and steady returns to investors over time. It is because the funds are majorly invested in companies with better track records and market reputations.

    "question": "GST on Personal Loans ‚Äì Its Impact & Working",
    "answer": "Overdraft vs Personal Loan: Find the Best OptionNovember 27, 2024Personal Loan Foreclosure ‚Äì All You Need To KnowNovember 27, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle When we need funds to manage some big or unexpected finances, most of us take a personal loan to arrange for the money. Personal loans can be used for various purposes without a specific end-usage, and you can avail of them without needing any collateral, so they are a popular credit instrument for almost everyone. You can use a personal loan to fund your education, pay for your dream wedding, expand your business, renovate your house, buy a car, or do anything else, and it is easy to repay personal loans through monthly EMIs. A few years ago, the Indian Government introduced GST, Goods and Service Tax, which replaced the older indirect tax systems. GST is also an indirect tax that replaces VAT, excise duty, service tax, etc. Every value addition is subject to the government‚Äôs multi-stage destination-based GST tax. People often ask how the GST affects personal loans and whether there is any GST on personal loans. This blog discusses all the questions regarding the impact of GST on personal loans, how it works, whether it has made personal loans more expensive, and more. Is GST Applicable on Personal Loans in India? When you apply for a personal loan at any bank or financial institution, remember that GST is charged on the service rendered by the lender. So, in a way, GST for personal loans is applicable only to a few components of your personal loan, and it does not affect the total amount of your loan. The interest rates, EMI amount, and principal will not be affected by GST. Therefore, GST is applicable to certain components of personal loans in India. Impact of GST on a Personal Loan GST was implemented on 1 July 2017 in India. Before that, personal loans were subject to a service tax of 15%. But now, the GST on personal loans is 18%. However, as discussed above, since GST is charged for the services provided by banking and financial institutions, it is imposed on processing fees, prepayment charges, and any other charges paid by the customer to the lender. GST is not charged on loan repayment or interest paid. Since loan repayment and interest are major components of a personal loan and GST is not applicable to those, the impact of GST on personal loans is not very high. What Components of a Personal Loan are Affected by the GST? It is important to understand the impact of GST on personal loans to know how it will affect the cost of your borrowing. The following are the components of a personal loan which are affected by GST: Processing Fee: The GST on personal loans is mainly charged on the processing fees. The GST on personal loan processing fees is charged at 18%, and since the process fees differ from lender to lender, the amount will depend on the lender you select. Loan Amount: GST does not directly affect the loan amount. However, since GST is charged on the processing fees, the loan amount can affect the processing fees. With a higher loan amount, the processing fees would also increase. EMI: GST is not applicable on the repayment of loans through EMI. Loan Tenure: GST does not affect the loan tenure, the period over which the personal loan is repaid. Prepayment or Pre-Closure Fees: Personal loans have to be repaid within a predetermined period. However, most lenders allow customers to repay the loan earlier, known as foreclosure of loan, and charge a small fee for providing this service. Since it is a service provided by the lender, GST on personal loan foreclosure is applicable at 18% of prepayment or pre-closure fees. Late Payment: When you default on your EMI payment or are late in paying the instalment, banks charge you a late payment fee or penalty. This late payment fee is also applicable to GST at 18%. Pros and Cons of GST on Personal Loans GST changed the Indian financial landscape and also affected the personal loan market. While GST has many advantages for personal loans, it also has a few drawbacks. Pros of GST on Personal Loans Uniform Tax Structure: The GST has simplified the tax code by doing away with several indirect taxes and fostering a more consistent and open atmosphere. Less Tax Evasion: Since the introduction of the GST, companies have found it more difficult to avoid paying taxes, which has increased government revenue. Lower Total Cost: In certain instances, GST has decreased the total cost of goods and services, which may help",

    "question": "Key Differences Between Stocks and Mutual Funds",
    "answer": "Terms and Conditions ‚Äì Big Bang Days! (‚ÄúCampaign‚Äù)December 19, 2022What is Switching in Mutual Funds and How Does it Work?December 22, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle It is a historically proven fact that investing in equities for the long term will result in wealth creation. Shares and mutual funds can potentially deliver high returns in the long run. If you are in a dilemma about whether to invest in stocks or mutual funds, then you are not alone. Millions of investors have the same question. But it is important to note that there is no right or wrong choice between the two; it‚Äôs a subjective decision. Shares and mutual funds give exposure to equity and can add value to your portfolio. We are not here to tell you which one is right. But we can help you choose by pointing out the differences between stocks and mutual funds. What are stocks or shares? A share represents a single unit of ownership of a company. Investors are called shareholders and are entitled to the company‚Äôs profits and losses in proportion to their shareholding. There are two types of shares, namely, equity and preference shares. Equity shares have voting rights and receive dividends. Equity shareholders have a say in the company‚Äôs important decisions, such as a dividend. Preference shares are entitled to the company‚Äôs dividends and are given preference before equity shares at the time of liquidation. However, they do not hold any voting rights. Shares have the potential to give large gains and can be easily traded on the stock exchange. However, they can also result in huge losses and require investors to do thorough research before investing in them. What are mutual funds? Mutual funds pool money from various investors and invest in equity and debt securities based on the investment objective. There are several types of mutual funds, but based on asset class, mutual funds are broadly categorized as equity, debt, and hybrid. Equity funds primarily invest in shares, debt funds invest in bonds and money market securities, and hybrid funds invest in both equity and debt securities. Mutual funds have several benefits, such as professional fund management and in-built diversification, and have lower expenses than shares. However, they are subject to fund managers‚Äô bias and can underperform when the markets drop. Differences between stocks and mutual funds Stocks and mutual funds are not mutually exclusive. If stocks are the parent, then mutual funds are its children. Though both invest in equities, there have several differences. The following table summarizes the differences between the two. Point of Difference Shares Mutual Funds Meaning Represents part ownership in the company. A collection of shares and securities. Investment Directly invests in the stock market. Invest in the fund which invests in the market. Management You manage your own portfolio and have complete control over it. Fund manager manages your portfolio, and you have no control over it. Return Potential to give very high returns. Can give high to moderate returns. Risk Very risky Relatively less risky Performance Returns depend on macro and micro-economic factors. Returns depend on fund manager expertise and macroeconomic factors. Diversification Is Possible if you invest in multiple stocks. Have in-built diversification. Trading Possible throughout the day Possible only once, at the end of the day Expenses Brokerage and transaction charges Management fees, transaction charges, and marketing fees Market knowledge Investors require market knowledge Investors need not have the market knowledge Convenience Investing through demat and trading accounts can be a tedious process Investments can be made within minutes Flexibility Shares do not have the features of SIP SIPs make investing easy. Tax benefits Shares don‚Äôt qualify for tax benefits. Investments in ELSS funds qualify for tax benefits under Section 80C. Following are the key differences between stocks and mutual funds: Meaning Stocks or shares are units of a company, and each unit represents a part of the company‚Äôs ownership. As a shareholder, you will own the shares of the company. In contrast, mutual funds are a collection of shares and debt securities. As a mutual fund investor, you will own units in the mutual fund, not shares of each company the fund invests in. Investment In the case of shares, you directly invest in the stock market to get ownership of shares. You invest in mutual funds, through which your investment is dir",

    "question": "What Is the Maximum Loan Duration for the Personal Loan?",
    "answer": "What is Retail Loan?: its Meaning, Types, BenefitsNovember 28, 2024How to Check My All Loan Details by Pan Number?November 29, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle The loan term you choose can have a major impact on your monthly payments and your overall finances. It‚Äôs an important decision because it affects how much you pay each month and how long it takes to repay the loan. If you go for shorter terms, loan will get quickly paid off and interest will be saved but your monthly payments will get higher. On the other hand, longer terms will make your monthly budgeting easier with spread out payments but your interest costs will be more. So, before you decide on it, let‚Äôs understand what both of the decisions will mean for you in the future, which option will pan out better and will be in alignment with your future goals. What is a Personal Loan? A personal loan is an unsecured loan. For this, you don‚Äôt need to provide assets like a car or house as collateral. This makes it a great choice for those who need to access funds without putting property on the line. These loans are really versatile as they can be used for a number of purposes, like covering unexpected expenses, consolidating debt, or funding major life events like weddings or holidays. This flexibility allows you to spend your money as per your needs, making it an attractive option for many borrowers. You have to repay these loans in monthly instalments over an agreed period of time. Therefore, it becomes important to choose a loan term that goes well with both your budget and financial goals. What is a Personal Loan Tenure? A personal loan tenure is simply the period you agree upon to pay back the loan amount, along with any interest. This timeframe shapes and decides your monthly payments along with the amount of interest you‚Äôll pay overall. You will probably get a lot of options for loan tenure from the lenders themselves, giving you space to choose one that works best for your financial situation. Picking a tenure that fits comfortably within your budget is very important for avoiding stress. What is the Maximum Loan Duration for a Personal Loan? The maximum loan duration for a personal loan in India typically ranges from 5 to 7 years, but it can vary depending on the lender and the borrower‚Äôs creditworthiness. Some lenders may offer longer tenures, up to 10 years in some cases. It‚Äôs important to note that while a longer tenure can result in lower monthly EMIs, it also means you‚Äôll end up paying more interest over the life of the loan. Therefore, it‚Äôs crucial to carefully consider your financial situation and choose a tenure that balances affordability and overall cost. Maximum Loan Duration for a Personal Loan with Jupiter Jupiter offers a maximum loan term of 24 months, giving you the flexibility to handle payments without having to give the long-term commitment. While some lenders are ready to extend loan terms to five or even seven years, Jupiter‚Äôs two-year limit actually encourages faster repayment, making it easier for you to stay focused and close out your loan efficiently and speedily. This shorter timeframe can prove itself to be a practical choice over the period of time. Ultimately, the right loan duration does both- keep payments manageable and support timely repayment. Minimum Loan Duration for a Personal Loan with Jupiter While most lenders start personal loan terms at 10 or 12 months, Jupiter allows for even shorter durations, going as brief as three months. This three-month term can be ideal for you if you‚Äôre borrowing a smaller amount or have a higher income, letting you pay off the loan quite quickly, keeping your finances more flexible and freeing you from long-term repayments. Factors to Consider When Choosing a Personal Loan Tenure A number of factors have to be considered while deciding on the tenure- factors that are tied to your present and can impact your future. Here‚Äôs what to think about: Monthly Budget Start with your budget. A shorter loan term will have higher monthly payments but will save you on overall interest. This will be a good choice if you‚Äôre comfortable with a larger monthly cost. But if you are not, and need smaller payments, go for a longer term that spreads out your loan, though you‚Äôll have to pay more in interest. Try to find a balance that works for your income without stressing your finances. Financial Goals Now, think about what‚Äôs important for your financial future. If you‚Äôre working on big goals like buying a ho",

    "question": "Commodity Mutual Funds: Meaning, Types, and Benefits",
    "answer": "ELSS vs Mutual Funds: Difference Between ELSS and Mutual FundJuly 7, 2023How to Save Income Tax on Salary? Tips to Save Money on TaxJuly 10, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Thanks to technology, investing has become easier than ever. Stocks, mutual funds, and fixed-income securities have been popular choices among investors for some time now. However, another asset class that is taking precedence among investors is commodities. Commodities are physical products used as raw materials for producing goods, such as crude oil, rubber, or agricultural commodities. You can invest in commodities directly by trading on the commodity exchange or indirectly by investing in commodity mutual funds. The article covers in detail commodity mutual funds, their types, and their advantages. What Are Commodity Mutual Funds? Commodity mutual funds invest at least 95% of their assets in agricultural commodities such as coffee, livestock, food grains, and seeds and non-agricultural commodities such as oil, fuels, textiles, and chemicals. The mutual fund makes a profit when the value of these commodities goes up, and it makes a loss when the underlying commodities price goes down. How Do Commodity Mutual Funds Work? The structure of commodity mutual funds is similar to Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) or Funds of Funds (FoF). They invest in commodities through Exchange Traded Commodity Derivatives (ETCD), which are futures and options of commodities. Alternatively, they invest in companies dealing with commodities such as natural resources or agricultural commodities. This is because SEBI doesn‚Äôt allow mutual funds to invest in physical commodities directly apart from gold. The performance of a commodity mutual fund depends on the performance of the underlying commodities in the fund. This directly affects the NAV (net asset value) of the fund. If the price of the commodity rises, the NAV of the fund also rises. If the fund manager books profits, it is equally divided among all the unit holders. In case the price of the commodity falls, the NAV of the fund also falls. Features of commodity mutual funds: Wide choice: There are multiple categories and subcategories of commodity mutual funds that invest in several commodities. You can choose from a wide variety of funds to invest in for your short and long-term goals. Hedge against market volatility and inflation: Commodity mutual funds are not affected by market movements. Moreover, they are inversely related to stock market movements. Hence, they act as a perfect hedge against market volatility and protect your portfolio from downside risk. Moreover, as inflation rises, commodity prices increase; hence they are one asset class that is positively impacted by inflation. Diversification: Commodity mutual funds are a perfect tool for diversification. They help reduce the downside risk in a portfolio by hedging the market and inflation risk. Experienced fund manager: Commodity trading is different from equity trading and requires a lot of experience. Hence the fund managers managing commodity funds are very experienced and can give you significantly high returns. Returns: Commodity mutual funds give higher profits when the underlying price of commodities rises. This happens when the demand for a commodity is higher than its supply. Investing in such commodities will increase the overall return of the fund. Risks: Commodity mutual funds are not affected by volatility in equity markets, but they are not risk-free. The prices of commodities are affected by rainfall, geopolitical factors such as war, and natural disasters such as earthquakes. Types of Commodity Mutual Funds There are different types of commodity mutual funds in India. These vary based on their investment objective and investment strategy: Natural resources fund: This type of commodity fund invests in companies that have exposure to natural resources such as oil, gold, silver, and renewable energy. Natural resources fund doesn‚Äôt directly invest in natural resources but in companies that deal in these resources. So, the profit of the fund depends on the prices of natural recourses and the performance of these companies on the stock market. Basic or true commodities fund: Basic or true commodities funds invest directly in physical commodities that occur naturally, such as metals, food grains, etc. They are very risky as they are prone to fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities. However, they are quite a popular kind of commodity f",

    "question": "A Complete Guide on Real Estate Mutual Funds: ‚Äì Jupiter Money",
    "answer": "Jupiter Takes On Shady Loan App With It‚Äôs On Demand Salary MockumentrySeptember 1, 2023Best Time to Buy & Sell Mutual Funds in IndiaSeptember 8, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle For many of us, owning a house is a dream. However, with real estate prices going through the roof, owning a house remains a dream for many. This should discourage you from investing in the real estate market and make the most of this growth. There are many alternatives to investing in a house or a piece of land or house. One of the most popular alternatives is real estate mutual funds. In this article, we cover real estate mutual funds, its features, advantages and risks in detail. What are real estate mutual funds? Real estate mutual funds are sectoral funds that primarily invest in securities of real estate companies or in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). The fund manager pools money from investors and invests in these companies. So technically, the fund manager is providing the real estate companies with capital to build and develop properties. When the share price of these companies rises, or when the real estate market goes up, the mutual fund will make a profit. Following are the features of real estate mutual funds. Minimum investment: With the ever-rising prices of real estate, investing in this sector has become out of reach for the common man. However, in the case of real estate mutual funds, you can still participate in this sector with a minimum investment of Rs. 1,000. Investment horizon: Real estate is a long-term sector, as it takes time to build and sell property. Hence the ideal investment horizon for these funds is over five years. Alternative to buying a property: Real estate funds are an excellent alternative to buying a physical property. It eliminates the risk of litigation and the hassle of maintaining a property. Moreover, it also reduces the time and effort in buying a property. Returns: Real estate fund‚Äôs return depends on the real estate sector. However, in the long term, these funds can offer decent returns. Risk: Real estate funds are prone to sector risk. If the sector collapses, so will the companies in the industry, which will affect the fund. Liquidity: Real estate mutual funds are very liquid when compared to physical property. Investors can cash out their investments and get the investment proceeds in their bank account within a day. Expense ratio: Real estate mutual funds have an expense ratio similar to other mutual funds. It is usually a percentage of the investment amount. Profit sharing with long-term growth: Real estate mutual funds invest in REITs and shares of real estate companies. The fund can earn profits from REITs and enjoy long-term growth benefits from shares of real estate companies. Minimal investor‚Äôs effort: Investing in real estate funds doesn‚Äôt require you to go through a ton of paperwork, and it also reduces the hassle of finding a good property to invest in. When it comes to real estate mutual funds, the investor‚Äôs efforts are very minimal, and they get to enjoy the full benefits. Diversification: Fund managers of real estate mutual funds invest across different properties, including residential, commercial, rental, and hospitality projects. Hence as an investor, you can enjoy the benefits of a diversified portfolio of properties. No direct role of investors: As an investor in a real estate mutual fund, you will have no control over your money as the fund manager decides the portfolio of the company. Moreover, you do not own the shares of the company directly, so you won‚Äôt have any voting rights. How do real estate mutual funds work? Real estate mutual funds are similar to other equity mutual funds. The manager pools money from different investors with similar objectives and invests them in REITs and shares of real estate companies. The profits arising from the REITs are distributed to all mutual fund unit holders, whereas the capital appreciation in the shares of the real estate companies will increase your portfolio returns. Who should invest in real estate mutual funds? Real estate mutual funds best suit small investors who lack the capital to invest in real estate properties. Since the investment in real estate mutual funds is low, it is accessible to everyone. These funds also suit investors who want to gain from the real estate market boom. If you are looking to accumulate wealth from real estate, these are your go-to funds. Real estate funds ideally reap good returns in the l",

    "question": "What is CVV in a Credit Card?",
    "answer": "How to Save MoneyAugust 23, 2024Personal Loan Prepayment ‚Äì Part Prepayment, Charges, Features, and BenefitsAugust 23, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle When you use a credit card for online transactions, you might have noticed a small three- or four-digit number called the CVV on the back or front of your card. The CVV is a crucial security feature that helps protect your card from unauthorised use. Understanding what CVV is and how it works can give you greater confidence in your online and offline transactions, ensuring that your financial information remains secure. What is a CVV in a Credit Card? A CVV (Card Verification Value), on your credit card, is a three or four-digit number. This number is a security feature that keeps your credit card from undergoing any fraudulent activities, especially during online transactions. The CVV is a unique number printed on the back of your card and is essential to type in during any online transactions. Where to Find the CVV Number on Your Credit Card? The three or four-digit CVV number is printed on the credit card itself. If you have a MasterCard or Visa, the CVV will be three-digit and printed on the back of the card. But if you have an American Express card, the CVV will be four digits and will be printed on the front of the card. The CVV is usually printed beside your account number. What is the Purpose of a CVV on Your Credit Card and Why is it Important? Your CVV number serves as an essential safeguard against credit card fraud, adding an extra layer of security to your transactions. It helps merchants verify that the person using the card is indeed the cardholder. Given that credit card fraud is the most prevalent form of identity theft, as highlighted by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the CVV plays a crucial role in safeguarding your financial information. CVV numbers are classified as sensitive authentication data. Merchants are obligated to protect this information and ensure that the CVV number is deleted once the transaction is approved. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that not every online retailer requires the CVV for purchases, and there may be instances where it does not fully shield you from credit card fraud. How is the CVV Generated? You might think CVVs are just some random machine-generated codes that every card uniquely has. But surprisingly, they aren‚Äôt just random three- or four-digit codes. Banks actually create them using four specific pieces of information: the primary account number, a pair of DES (Data Encryption Standard) keys, a four-digit expiration date, and a three-digit service code. The exact algorithms involved in this process remain confidential for security reasons. How to Protect Your CVV and Credit Card Your credit card is a financial tool that gives you an additional credit limit if you ever face a cash crunch. It‚Äôs important to keep it protected to avoid someone else misusing your credit limit to commit fraudulent transactions. Here‚Äôs how you can protect your CVV and your credit card: 01 Save Credit Card Information Cautiously Storing your credit or debit card details online can streamline the checkout process but also increase the risk of unauthorised transactions if your account is hacked. To enhance your security, think about using virtual card numbers. These are connected to your main credit card account but provide a different number for online payments, adding an extra layer of protection. 02 Shop on Legitimate Websites It‚Äôs important to recognise that not all businesses online are trustworthy. Avoiding sites that seem suspicious can significantly protect your information. When making a purchase, ensure that the website‚Äôs URL begins with ‚Äúhttps://‚Äù (with an ‚Äús‚Äù at the end) or displays a lock icon before the URL. These indicators suggest that the site is secure and that your data is encrypted. 03 Stay Alert of Any Phishing Attempts Have you ever received a suspicious text message that felt like a scam? Or perhaps a strange call requesting personal information? These are often types of phishing scams. Whether they come via email, text, or phone, staying vigilant against scams is essential. Always refrain from sharing personal details, your CVV, or clicking on dubious links. Here are some helpful practices to follow: Only provide your account information over the phone if you‚Äôre certain of the caller‚Äôs identity. If in doubt, consider reaching out to the organisation directly. Never lend your card to anyone. Use multifactor authentica",

    "answer": "What Are the Benefits of PF?June 30, 2023ELSS vs Mutual Funds: Difference Between ELSS and Mutual FundJuly 7, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle At Jupiter, we understand that our customers are concerned about frozen bank accounts. We want to clarify why bank accounts may be frozen and what steps you can take to resolve the issue. Before we begin, we‚Äôd like to clarify that Jupiter itself is not a bank and doesn‚Äôt hold a banking license. All bank accounts on Jupiter are powered by Federal Bank, an RBI licensed bank. The following information is as per the regulations suggested by Federal Bank and the RBI. An account gets frozen when our partner bank finds any suspicious activity happening in the account. This freeze is for your and everyone‚Äôs safety and security. All banks, by law, are required to monitor their customers‚Äô transactions and report any suspicious activity like Unexplained transactions, Incorrect/invalid documents or details provided at the time of onboarding, and issues relating to money laundering etc.. If a bank suspects such activity on an account, it may freeze the account and report it to the authorities. Why does a bank freeze your account? If there is unusual activity on an account, such as a large influx of funds, unusual transactions or suspicious activities during account onboarding, the bank may decide to freeze the account until they can investigate and confirm the legitimacy of the activity. For which, the bank expects cooperation from its customers. A bank account may also be frozen if there is a court order, legal judgment, or other legal action that requires the account to be frozen or restricted. Let‚Äôs dive deeper Bank accounts can be frozen due to a law enforcement agency complaint (NPCI, NCCRP, Cybercrime, etc.). In this case, the account cannot be unfrozen by the bank or Jupiter until the customer has resolved the complaint with the concerned authority. A bank account can also be frozen as a preventive measure to ensure that the customer and platform are safe. Such accounts can be unfrozen on receipt of the necessary documents supporting the transaction/s in question. How do you know if your account is frozen? When you try to perform any transaction, you may receive a message stating ‚ÄúYour account is frozen.‚Äù Additionally, an email communication will be sent to you informing you of the reason for the freeze and the next steps. On Jupiter, this is how the message is shown: How to unfreeze account on Jupiter? Contact the Jupiter Cybercare team: The first step is to review your registered email address for an email from cybercare@jupiter.money. Details of the freeze are shared with you over the email. If you have not received the email please contact the Cybercare team on email (cybercare@jupiter.money) and understand the reason for the freeze. Depending upon the reason, our team will also discuss the next steps you need to take to resolve the issue. Provide necessary documentation: Depending on the reason for the freeze, you may need to provide documentation or other information to Jupiter Cybercare team so as to verify your identity, confirm transactions, or resolve any issues that caused the freeze. Resolve legal issues, if any: If the freeze was due to an outstanding complaint from a legal body, it needs to be resolved. Please work with the Cybercare team to get the complaint details. Once the issue is resolved, wait for the freeze to be lifted. Be patient: Depending on the reason for the freeze, it may take some time for the freeze to be lifted. Be patient and continue to work with the Cybercare team to resolve the issue. Typically, if you provide a satisfactory response and documents, the account should be unfrozen within 24-48 working hours. Note ‚Äì If you have a Minimum KYC account, you are required to complete video KYC as well. For unresolved cases In case of non-remedial reasons, Jupiter CyberCare shall decide to not unfreeze the account. In such a scenario, Jupiter CyberCare team shall suggest the route for account closure, and any outstanding balance in the account will be sent to the user‚Äôs alternate account after the closure is completed. However, there are certain cases of fraud, where a closure is not permitted until the concern is resolved. Similarly, in case of outstanding regulatory complaints on the account, a closure is not permitted and a validation of the No Objection Certificate/unfreeze letter from the investigating authority is required to proceed.

But, when it comes to the cost of living in Pune vs Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, and other southern cities the expenses for staying over here may seem higher than other places. The overall cost of residing in the city depends on different factors like accommodation type, locality, and much more. Check out the average rent for: Cost of Living in Pune for Students and bachelors: The cost of living in Pune for a bachelor or a student is comparatively lower than other metro cities like Mumbai or Delhi.

Cost of Living in Pune for Couples: If you and your spouse want to stay in a plush area such as Koregaon Park or Viman Nagar, the living cost will be high. A rented 1 BHK in these affluent areas costs about ‚Çπ20,000 to ‚Çπ25,000 per month. Cost of Living in Pune for Family with children: You might need a 2 BHK to live comfortably with your spouse and children. The monthly rent for a 2 BHK in happening localities like Koregaon Park is around ‚Çπ30,000 to ‚Çπ45,000. You can get a similar house for a monthly rent of ‚Çπ20,000 to ‚Çπ30,000 in Kothrud.

This article will provide a comprehensive overview of the legal considerations and financial requirements for foreign nationals from India interested in purchasing property in the United States. Additionally, we will address the specifics concerning an Indian citizen‚Äôs ability to purchase property in the United States. It will explore relevant laws, regulations, and procedures that may need to be followed for such a transaction. Let‚Äôs learn about Can an Indian Buy Property in USA. Who Can Buy a Property in the USA? So, are you thinking about how to invest in property in the USA without carrying a green card, or citizenship of the country? Look no further; your answer is right here. As a buyer, you do not need to carry a green card or be a citizen of the States to be able to invest in US real estate. Anyone securing an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, an alternative to Social Security Number for foreigners, can invest their valuable money in real estate in the States. To obtain this number, you must apply to the Internal Revenue Service. Under IRS Publication 515 for Non-Resident Alien (NRA), a foreigner with any country citizenship willing to buy a property in the USA can buy one. And if you are an Indian, below are the immigration categories that can get you a property in the country: Born in India or is a Green Card holder You are an Indian resident with a foreign national visa of L1 or H1B with either established or no established USA credit history Indian newcomer to the USA with a J1, F1, L1, H1B, or other types of visa with no established credit How to Finance Real Estate in the USA Without Being a Citizen of the Country?

According to the National Association of Realtors, the 2022 International Transactions in US Residential Real Estate figure showed that Indian investors are among the top foreign buyers in USA real estate, comprising 5% ($3.6B value). But as an investor in this sector, do you have questions about financing that purchase? Well, here‚Äôs how you can do it: Make a Cash Purchase: You can make a simple cash purchase if you have enough money in your bank account to purchase the property outright. This can be possible by taking money from your family through an international money transfer. Get Private Lenders: You can always contact private lenders to help finance your real estate investment in the USA as a foreigner. But before you approach them, you need to remember that they offer high-interest rates, and their loan terms may also be less favourable. So, research before making a decision. Try Traditional Mortgages: There are also private lenders in the United States to provide you with mortgages, but their terms and conditions are more stringent. You might even have to hold the best credit score, provide a higher down payment, and tick other strict criteria before getting a mortgage. So, shop around before going after one lender to find the terms and conditions best suit you. What are the Tax Implications to Buy Property in the USA as a foreigner?

    "question": "Mutual Fund Penalty: Meaning, Consequences and How to Avoid It?",
    "answer": "How Many Mutual Funds Should I Invest In & How Much Is Too Much?December 11, 2022How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains on Debt Mutual Fund?December 13, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle A systematic Investing Plan (SIP) is a feature offered by mutual funds so that you can invest systematically over a period of time. Through SIP, you can invest a certain amount every month. This amount is directly auto-debited from your bank on a specific date chosen by you. But what happens when there is not enough balance in your account? Read to find out the consequences of missing a SIP installment and how to escape a mutual fund penalty. Consequences of missing a SIP If you don‚Äôt maintain sufficient balance in your account on the date of the SIP, you will miss an instalment. Following are the consequences of missing a SIP. Can‚Äôt fulfill goals on time: By investing a certain amount every month, you are accumulating wealth in the long term to fulfill your goals. But if you miss an installment, you are extending the target date of your goal by some time. So, every time you miss your SIP installment, you push the date further and won‚Äôt be able to fulfill your goals on time. Pay a penalty: When you set up a SIP, you authorize the Electronic Clearance Service (ECS) and National Automated Clearing House (NACH) with the bank to auto-debit a certain amount on a specific date. Every month on the day of the SIP installment, the Asset Management Company (AMC) sends a request to the bank, and the bank, on your behalf, pays the SIP installment from your account. If you don‚Äôt have enough balance, the bank rejects the request from the AMC. The AMC doesn‚Äôt charge any penalty for a missed SIP, but the bank does. YourYour bank charges a penalty in the range of Rs 250-750 for every missed SIP for not maintaining sufficient balance in the account. Cancellation of SIP: If you miss three consecutive SIP installments, then the AMC will automatically cancel your SIP. The existing investments will not be disturbed and will keep earning returns for you, but no additional investment will go through from your account. In case you want to restart the SIP, then you will have to start over the entire SIP process and set up an auto-debit again. How to avoid penalties on SIP? It is possible to avoid penalties on SIP by simply maintaining the minimum balance in your account. Make sure you maintain the required balance in your account on the date of SIP. You can set up the SIP date a day or two after you receive your paycheque, so you never miss the SIP instalment. Alternatively, you can pause the SIP if you don‚Äôt have the required balance. All AMCs and mutual fund platforms have the facility to pause your SIP. This way, the AMC will not send a request to the bank on the date of SIP, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about the penalty if you don‚Äôt have enough balance. You can restart the SIP whenever you want without any hassle. But what if you forget to restart your SIP or don‚Äôt receive your salary on time? You are missing out on your investments, and you end up paying the penalty for your missed installments. Investing is supposed to be simple and hassle-free, and not filled with penalties. Hence, we at Jupiter money introduced no penalty SIP. What is no penalty SIP? No penalty SIP is a feature introduced by Jupiter Money, where you don‚Äôt have to pay the penalty for your skipped SIPs.

    "question": "Mutual Fund Diversification: Meaning, How it Works, and Advantages",
    "answer": "Portfolio Diversification: Types, Strategies, Benefits & LimitationJune 27, 2023Fundamental Analysis vs Technical Analysis: Meaning and Key DifferencesJune 27, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Diversification is a risk management technique that you can use to reduce the risk of investing. In diversification, you spread your investment across different securities, asset classes, and industries. The primary idea behind this is to negate the downside risk of one security with another so the overall portfolio returns are maintained. So, a diversified portfolio will include different asset classes such as equity, debt, government securities, commodities, or currency. However, it is also important to diversify within an asset class. If you decide to invest in mutual funds, you must ensure that your mutual fund portfolio is diversified. What is mutual fund diversification? Diversification in mutual funds means spreading out your investments to lower the chances of losing money. It‚Äôs like not putting all your eggs in one basket to reduce risks. Investing in mutual funds to build wealth is an excellent idea. This is because equity mutual funds have the potential to give high returns in the long term. Moreover, mutual funds invest in several companies, which automatically ensures diversification. Another advantage of investing in mutual funds is that they spare you the effort of picking individual stocks. However, investing in just one mutual fund doesn‚Äôt mean your portfolio is diversified. Imagine if that one mutual fund you invested in started giving losses; all your hard-earned money would vanish right in front of you. Hence it is important to diversify your mutual fund portfolio as well. How does diversification work in mutual funds? There is always a risk of underperformance when it comes to investing. Since mutual funds invest in marketable securities and are managed by fund managers who base their decisions on research and assumptions, there is a higher risk of a fund underperforming when compared to the market of other funds. Hence it is important that you spread your investment across multiple mutual funds, so you can reduce the downside risk and maintain the overall portfolio return. When you invest in multiple mutual funds with different portfolios, and time horizons, the loss in one mutual fund can be nullified with the profit from another mutual fund. However, for this to work, it is important to invest in mutual funds that are not correlated. This means you must invest in mutual funds spread across different industries, geographies, and time horizons. For example, if you invested in a fund which is the majority of the exposure to travel companies, then in times when inflation is high, the profit margins of these companies might contract, affecting the performance of the fund. If you invested in a fund with major exposure to commodities, then the profit from this fund can negate the loss of the first fund. Hence with mutual fund diversification, you can reduce the downside risk and maintain your portfolio returns, which ultimately will help accumulate wealth in the long run. How to diversify your mutual fund portfolio? To have a diversified mutual fund portfolio, you must carefully choose funds with exposure to diverse securities. The following points will guide you in diversifying your mutual fund portfolio. Diversify across different schemes Mutual funds are broadly categorized into equity, debt, and hybrid mutual funds, and each of these categories has different types under them. For example, equity funds are divided into large cap, mid cap, small cap, value funds, and thematic funds. Debt funds are divided into liquid, ultra-short-term, credit-risk, and long-duration funds. Finally, hybrid funds are divided into aggressive, conservative, and balanced funds. Investing across several types of mutual funds will ensure your portfolio is well diversified. Diversify across time horizons Invest in mutual funds with different time horizons. Equity funds, by default, are a long-term investment option and suit a horizon of more than five years. Debt mutual funds, on the other hand, are suitable for shorter horizons. You can use hybrid funds for a duration of three to five years. So, spreading your investment across different time horizons will reduce the impact of market volatility on your portfolio. Diversify across different fund managers and fund houses Mutual funds are managed by fund managers who are professionals wit",

    "question": "Tax & Inflation Effect on Investment",
    "answer": "Tax on Salary: How to Calculate TDS on Salary?July 18, 2024What is Variable Pay ‚Äì All You Need to KnowJuly 23, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Ôªø Financial independence is everyone‚Äôs dream and one way to achieve it is by investing in different types of products like mutual funds, fixed-income securities, shares, and much more. You may often look for different options to determine the returns offered by various investment products. However, you may not know that these earnings are nominal returns and not the actual money you will receive in your pocket. Well, your return on investment is affected by inflation and taxes. Read on to know more. What Is Inflation? You may have heard this term frequently but do you know what is inflation rate? In simple terms, inflation means the rising living cost over a period or the lower value of money. It is the general increase in the price of goods and services over the years, which decreases your purchasing power. For example, the price of a movie ticket five years ago was significantly lower than what it is today. So, if the inflation rate is 2% and the movie ticket costs INR 100 today, its price one year later will be INR 102. What Is Inflation Rate? The retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is 5.08% for the month of June, 2024. The CPI rose from 4.80% in May, 2024. The inflation rate for rural and urban is 5.66% and 4.39% respectively. Now, to understand this, retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) represents the percentage increase in the price level of a basket of consumer goods and services over a specific period, compared to the same period in the previous year. In this case, for June 2024, the overall retail inflation is 5.08%. This means that on average, the prices of goods and services have increased by 5.08% compared to June 2023. The CPI is often broken down into rural and urban inflation rates to reflect the different consumption patterns and price movements in these areas. For June 2024: Rural inflation is 5.66%, indicating that prices in rural areas have increased by 5.66% compared to June 2023. Urban inflation is 4.39%, indicating that prices in urban areas have increased by 4.39% compared to June 2023. Types of Inflation Inflation is a quantitative measure of changes in prices of goods and services over a period and is denoted as a percent. As inflation increases, the purchasing power decreases and vice versa. Here are the 3 types of inflation. Demand-pull inflation: It results when the demand for the goods and services exceeds their supply, and this difference results in a price increase. Cost-push inflation: It is the result of the increase in production costs due to rising input prices like those of labor and raw materials. Built-in inflation: It is the effect of future expectations; higher prices result in more wages, which offer better living standards, thereby continuing the cycle Inflation Effect on Investment The effects of inflation are not limited to lower purchasing power. It may result in the demand for higher wages to meet rising prices, which may mean more unemployment due to lay-offs. High inflation can also weaken the country‚Äôs currency and make domestic products less competitive in the global markets. What Is Nominal Rate of Return? When you invest in any asset class, the potential returns are always nominal as these are calculated before tax and inflation. The nominal rate of return is the profit on your investments before considering factors like inflation, investment fees, and taxes. Therefore, when you say that your investment returns are 10%, it actually means the nominal return is 10%. Comparing nominal returns of different asset classes helps you make the right investment decision as tax implications for every financial instrument may vary. Nominal Rate of Return Calculation The formula to calculate nominal return is as follows: (End Value ‚Äì Begin Value) / Begin Value Let us understand this with an example, assume that you invested INR 10 lakh one year ago and its value today is INR 11 lakh, the nominal return is as follows: (1100000 ‚Äì 1000000)/1000000 = 1,00,000, which is 10% returns on your initial investment What Is After-Tax Real Rate of Return? The post-tax earnings are the returns after adjusting for the tax implications on the profits. Generally, the tax implications vary from one asset class to another and are also dependent on the investment horizon, age, and income tax slab. After-Tax Real Rate of ",

    "question": "How Many Mutual Funds Should I Invest In & How Much Is Too Much?",
    "answer": "Understanding Compounding in Mutual FundsDecember 8, 2022Mutual Fund Penalty: Meaning, Consequences and How to Avoid It?December 12, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Ever heard of the saying ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt put your eggs in one basket? It basically means diversifying your investments to reduce the risk of investing. But mutual funds already invest in multiple stocks, so isn‚Äôt one mutual fund enough to spread your risk? Well, the answer is no. One mutual fund has a little bit of everything but not enough of anything. Hence investing in one mutual fund is not enough. This might lead you to the question, ‚Äòhow many mutual funds should I have in my portfolio?‚Äô Read to find out the answer to this and how to build a mutual fund portfolio. Diversification of Mutual Funds Diversification is a risk management strategy wherein you spread your investments across multiple asset classes to reduce the portfolio‚Äôs overall risk. The idea behind diversification is that the risk of an individual security is reduced, and the portfolio will give higher returns in the long term. So basically, the underperformance of an asset is negated by the good performance of other assets, and the overall portfolio returns will be maintained in the short term. Diversification doesn‚Äôt eliminate the market risk, but it tends to reduce it by making your portfolio strong enough to face market volatility. Diversification is very important when investing in mutual funds. This is because the markets are not stable. Instability in the markets can lead to fluctuations in your portfolio as well. If one fund isn‚Äôt performing well, it doesn‚Äôt mean others do too. Diversification works well in mutual funds only if you spread your investments across asset classes and investment styles. This means investing in equity, debt, or gold funds and also ensuring you diversify within the asset class. Take, for example, equity funds. Invest in large, small, and mid-cap, or value and growth funds to reduce your risk of investing in equity. However, you have to be careful when diversifying. The major risk of diversification is over-diversification. Investing in too many mutual funds can actually harm your portfolio than do you good. Disadvantages of Diversification Over-diversification is simply diversifying too much. It happens when each additional asset added to the portfolio reduces overall return greater than risk reduction. In other words, when you over-diversify, you are not benefitting from that additional asset. Instead, you are increasing the portfolio‚Äôs risk. The following are the risks of over-diversification: Overall returns are affected: The overall portfolio returns are lower than you expected, mainly because the incremental asset is not adding value to the portfolio. In fact, it is harming the portfolio. Moreover, the purpose of diversification is lost, which is risk reduction. Higher expenses: By investing in multiple funds, you are incurring higher expenses. The overall cost increases, ultimately leading to lower returns. Difficult to monitor: The more the number of funds, the more difficult it is to monitor your portfolio. You have to keep track of all the funds and ensure they are performing well. The more the number of funds, the longer it takes to monitor your portfolio. This might ultimately discourage you from monitoring your portfolio, which might harm your portfolio. What is the 12-20-80 (baara, bees, aur assi) rule? Quantum Mutual Fund has introduced the 12-20-80 rule for asset allocation. Using this strategy, you can build a balanced portfolio to earn wealth in the long term and reduce downside volatility in the short term. 12 months ‚Äì Liquid fund: An emergency can knock on your door anytime. Hence it is important that you have a backup plan for such situations. Park at least 12 months of expenses in a liquid fund. This fund can be used to pay for bills, or expenses, during emergencies. 20% ‚Äì Invest 20% of your portfolio in gold. This will help you create a hedge against market volatility and inflation. Historically, gold always outperformed well when the markets underperformed, and vice versa. Hence investing 20% in gold will help balance the risk in your portfolio. Invest in gold ETFs or bonds, as they are very liquid and are safer than physical gold. 80% ‚Äì Invest 80% of your portfolio in equities to create wealth in the long term. Within equities, makes sure you invest across funds with different market capitalization and investment styles. Every investment sho",

    "question": "How to Get Credit Card Without CIBIL Score?",
    "answer": "Best Credit Cards for Movie Tickets & OTT Subscriptions in India 2025January 27, 202515 Best Airport Lounge Access Credit Cards in India 2025January 31, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle No CIBIL score? No problem! You might think that securing a credit card is impossible without a stellar credit history, but that‚Äôs not entirely true. Many people find themselves in a situation where they need a credit card but lack a CIBIL score. Whether you‚Äôre a young adult just starting out or someone looking to rebuild their credit, this guide will equip you with practical strategies to get a credit card, even without a perfect financial history. What is the CIBIL score? A CIBIL score is a three-digit number ranging from 300 to 900 that reflects your creditworthiness. It‚Äôs essentially a numerical representation of your credit history, showing lenders how reliable you are at repaying borrowed money. This score is calculated based on information from your credit report, which includes details about your loans, credit cards, and payment history. A higher CIBIL score generally indicates a better credit profile, making it easier to secure loans and credit cards with favourable terms. Why Do Banks and Financial Institutions Check CIBIL Score Before Issuing a Credit Card? Banks and financial institutions check an individual‚Äôs CIBIL score before issuing a credit card because credit cards are unsecured loans. They use the CIBIL score to assess whether the applicant is likely to repay the credit card bills responsibly. A poor credit history or a record of missed payments increases the risk of default, which can result in financial losses for the bank. To minimise this risk, banks review the applicant‚Äôs credit history to ensure they are financially capable of handling a credit card. When a bank requests information, TransUnion CIBIL Limited provides the individual‚Äôs credit report and score. Banks analyse records of late payments, defaults, and existing loans or credit cards to evaluate the individual‚Äôs payment behaviour. A low CIBIL score indicates potential difficulties in paying credit card bills. It‚Äôs important to note that a lack of credit history can sometimes be viewed as a negative factor as well. Minimum CIBIL Score Needed to Avail a Regular Credit Card CIBIL scores generally range from 300 to 900, with a higher score indicating better creditworthiness. A score close to 900 is considered excellent, while a score of 700 or above is typically deemed good. Most banks and financial institutions usually require a CIBIL score of 700-750 or higher to issue a regular credit card. However, there are no strict rules, and some banks may offer credit cards to individuals with lower scores as well. How To Get Credit Card Without CIBIL Score? To get a regular credit card without a CIBIL score, consider the following options: 01 Get a Secured Credit Card This is a straightforward way to obtain a credit card if you don‚Äôt have a CIBIL score. With a secured credit card, you make a deposit into a fixed deposit account with a bank. The bank then issues a credit card against fd with a limit based on your deposit, typically between 70% to 90% of the deposit amount. This helps you build your CIBIL score over time. Why Choose a Secured Credit Card? A secured credit card is a game-changer for those looking to establish or improve their credit history. Here‚Äôs why: ‚Üí Easier Approval: No CIBIL score?

    "question": "Understanding Collateral Meaning- Types of Collateral & Examples",
    "answer": "Government Pension Schemes for Senior Citizens 2025July 18, 2024Tax on Salary: How to Calculate TDS on Salary?July 18, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Most individuals and businesses avail different types of loans for meeting their fund requirements. People often take loans for buying a home or car. Moreover, they may avail of personal finance to pay for holidays, weddings, or other requirements. On the other hand, businesses avail of loans for meeting their working capital, equipment purchase, inventory building, and other requirements. Loans can either be secured or unsecured. The former is secured against certain assets like the home or car purchased using the money. The latter is provided without any security, and therefore, it is a riskier option for the loan providers. What Is Collateral? Collaterals are some types of assets accepted by lenders and act as security for the borrowed amount. Some common types of assets include real estate, investments, gold, vehicles, and much more. These assets provide security to the lenders against potential defaults. If the borrower defaults on the repayment, the lender can repossess the security and can sell it to partially or completely recover the outstanding dues. How Collateral Works? Before sanctioning your loan application, the financial institution evaluates your repayment capabilities. Therefore, they require some form of security, which reduces their risks. The security can be repossessed and sold by the lender if you default on the loan repayment. The possible loss of your asset ensures you repay the loan on time. The nature of the loan determines what is the collateral. For example, if you take out a home loan, the security will be the property. Similarly, the car is the security when you avail of a vehicle loan. Moreover, other types of borrowings can be secured against various assets. Examples of Collateral Residential Mortgage This is a type of loan where your house is used as secured collateral. If you default on the equated monthly installment (EMI) for a particular period, the lender can take legal action to repossess your property. They may then sell the house to recover their dues. Home Equity Loans Similar to a home loan, equity loans convert the property‚Äôs equity into cash. A fixed-rate loan offers a fixed amount, which is paid in EMIs. The interest rate is fixed during the entire loan tenure. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) approves a certain amount based on the equity available in your property. This money can then be withdrawn as needed. Moreover, the monthly installment varies on the withdrawn amount and rate of interest. Loan Against Property (LAP) You may borrow money against an existing property and use it for any purpose. The lender creates a lien on the property to recover losses in case of default. LAP is similar to a regular mortgage loan. However, the former restricts the use of the borrowed amount to purchase or construct a new home. Automobile Loans You may avail of such loans when you buy a new car or other vehicles, which can be used for any purpose. However, commercial vehicle loans cannot be used for personal use, and you must have an existing business to avail of this facility. Lenders also provide vehicle loans on used automobiles. Loan Against Securities Loans against securities are extended overdraft facilities offered by financial institutions. You may use your investments in shares, mutual funds, fixed deposits, bonds, and much more as financial collateral to avail of a credit limit. Generally, loans against securities are short-term credit facilities. Business Loans Lenders accept different types of assets like plant and machinery, business property, investments, accounts receivable, insurance policies, and much more to offer loans to business owners. Different Types of Collateral The types of collateral generally depend on the kind of loan applied for. Some of the commonly accepted assets are as follows: Property Home loans, LAP, and home equity loans are secured against real estate. It can also be used to avail of business or secured personal finance. The lender creates a lien on the property while offering such loans. Investments Also known as security-based lending or stock-based lending, you may use your investments to borrow money from financial institutions. Some of the eligible financial instruments include shares, bonds, fixed deposits, mutual funds, and much more. However, if the value of these investments falls below t",

    "answer": "Remuneration, Salary, And Compensation ‚Äì Definition, Meaning, and TypesMarch 27, 2025What is Disbursement ‚Äì Definition, How It Works, Types, ExamplesMarch 27, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle In today‚Äôs world, where everything is digitized, shopping has become way easier than it was before. With one-click purchases, and same-day delivery options, the convenience of shopping has increased. However, with increased ease, people are overspending money. In their words, they are spending beyond their means. This is impacting their financial health and well-being. Read to find out why people overspend, its effects, and how to control it. What is Overspending? An act of spending more than what you have or plan for is overspending. In other words, it simply means you are living beyond your means. If you are unable to cover your expenses with what you earn, even though you earn enough to fund all your expenses, you are overspending. Another example of overspending is you are unable to save enough for your goals as you have too many expenses. The feeling of never having enough money, having a low balance in your bank account, and using too many credit cards, are all signs of overspending. Different Types of Overspending Spending too much money unnecessarily is never good. It will create a dent in your finances and will not let you reach your financial goals. The first step to overcoming overspending is to understand where you are overspending. You may never realize it, but you might be overspending a lot more than you think. That one purchase you make might be an unnecessary expense, which you usually consider a necessity. Take a look at different kinds of overspending that most of us don‚Äôt realize that we are doing. Image spending Using money in highly visible ways to improve your image is a sign of overspending money. If you are buying designer wear, expensive bags, or luxury cars for getting preferential treatment and to show off, then you are image spending. Bargain hunting If you are constantly looking for deals and discounts and base your purchases on them, you are bargain-hunting. Even if you don‚Äôt need that particular item, you will still end up purchasing it as it is available at a reasonable price. Here, you get more satisfaction from the discount than the product itself. Compulsive spending Using shopping as a distraction from negative feelings or getting a high feeling from a purchase is compulsive shopping. Signs of compulsive shopping include uncontrollable shopping and not knowing what, where and how much you spend during a shopping spree. If you have clothes or accessories that you aren‚Äôt using or have price tags on them, you most likely bought those items to crave your satisfaction. Spending for others Many don‚Äôt realize this but end up spending for others to win approval and acceptance and to fit in. For example, paying the bill at a restaurant which can be easily split, or buying gifts for friends and family without an occasion. Bulimic spending Spending money for the heck of it because you earn a lot and don‚Äôt know what to do is a sign of bulimic spending. One sign of this is that you mostly will most regret a purchase either immediately or later in life. Effects of Overspending Spending outside your means once in a while is fine, but if it becomes a habit, the consequences can be disastrous. Following are some of the dangers of overspending. Falling into a debt trap When overspending becomes a habit, there is a high risk of you using debt. When you don‚Äôt have enough to spend, you will automatically start relying on credit cards to cover your expenses. Once you start using credit for day-to-day expenses, you will end up in a vicious debt trap. Poor credit score When you start relying on credit cards for small expenses, you are using bad credit, which has high-interest rates. The higher the debt you use on a daily basis, the harder it will get to obtain credit. Moreover, when you want to apply for good credit, such as a home loan or car loan, it will be rejected as your credit looks unmanageable by your banker. Zero progress towards long-term financial goals With overspending, you are constantly paying off your past expenses with your current income. Hence you won‚Äôt have anything left for the future. It is always better to set aside money for your future self, so you have enough to cover your future expenses. You can surely enjoy the present and spend money, but it shouldn‚Äôt go overboard. It is best if you balan",

    "question": "How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains on Debt Mutual Fund?",
    "answer": "Mutual Fund Penalty: Meaning, Consequences and How to Avoid It?December 12, 20225 Easy And Different Ways To Invest In Mutual Funds OnlineDecember 14, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Before investing in any financial instrument, the first thing we check is the returns. We are more concerned about the profit that we overlook the tax we have to pay. No one likes unpleasant surprises, and tax on returns can be one if you don‚Äôt know how much tax you have to pay on the profit you make. In mutual funds, equity and debt funds are taxed differently. This article will cover the calculation of long-term capital gain on debt mutual funds in detail. What are capital gains for debt mutual funds? Debt funds are mutual funds that invest in debt securities such as money market instruments, government bonds, and corporate bonds. They give predictable and stable returns and are best suited for investors with short-term goals and low-risk tolerance. The returns you earn on debt mutual funds can either be in the form of interest or capital appreciation. Interest is the fixed return, whereas capital appreciation is the increase in the value of the fund due to market dynamics. These are called capital gains, and based on how long you hold them, capital gains are categorized as short-term and long-term. Short-term capital gains are profits earned within three years from the date of investment. Long-term capital gains, on the other hand, are profits earned after three years from the date of investment. Both short-term and long-term gains are taxed differently. You will be liable to pay tax on capital gains only when you sell your mutual fund investment. How are capital gains taxed? Short-term capital gains are taxed as per your income tax slab rate. So, if you sell your debt mutual funds before 36 months from the date of investment, your capital gains will be added to your income and taxed accordingly. You will have to pay long-term capital gains if you sell the investment after 36 months. The long-term capital gains are taxed at 10% without indexation benefits and 20% with indexation benefits. The dividends distributed by the fund house are also taxable. They are taxable at the investor‚Äôs income tax slab rate. Moreover, dividends beyond Rs 5,00 are subject to a TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) of 10%. What is the indexation benefit? Indexation is adjusting the value of investments through a price index so that your purchasing power is maintained post-inflation. With indexation, you can also reduce your tax burden. You can inflate the purchase price so that the gap between your purchase and sale price is reduced, lowering your taxable returns and tax liability. Indexation applies to long-term investments. With indexation, you can reduce your long-term capital gains and pay less tax. In mutual funds, indexation applies only to debt mutual funds. To calculate the indexed cost of acquisition, you will have to adjust the original cost using the price index. The formula for calculating the indexed cost of acquisition is given below. Indexed cost of acquisition = Original cost * (CII of the year of sale/CII of year of purchase), Where, CII is the cost inflation index, and the data is readily available on the income tax website. Let‚Äôs see how indexation will help reduce capital gains with the help of an example. Calculation of long-term capital gains on debt mutual funds Assume you had invested Rs 150,000 in a debt fund when the NAV was Rs 20 in 2016 and sold it after four years in 2020 when the NAV is Rs 25. Let‚Äôs see how to calculate the capital gains with indexation benefit and tax liability. The number of units you will get is 7,500 (Rs 150000/20) The capital gain per unit is Rs 5 (Rs 25-20) , and the total gain is Rs 37,500. But since you have invested for more than three years, you are eligible for an indexation benefit. Though it is optional, it is best to take the indexation benefit, as this will reduce your tax burden. To get an indexation benefit, we must first calculate the indexed cost of acquisition. The CII for 2016 is 254, and for 2022 is 289. Indexed cost of acquisition = 20 * (289/254) Indexed cost of acquisition = Rs 22.76 The indexed long-term gain is Rs 2.24 (Rs 25-22.76), and the total gain now is Rs 16,830.7. These are taxable gains and will be taxed at 20%. Hence your tax liability is Rs 3,366. Should you go for the indexation benefit? Indexation benefit will help you reduce your taxable capital gains and hence your tax liability.",

    "question": "A Step-by-Step Guide on How to Calculate HRA in Salary",
    "answer": "How To Convert Salary Account To Savings Account? Easy GuideFebruary 27, 2024Need Money Urgently? Best Ways You Can Get Fast CashMarch 1, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle What is HRA in Salary? House Rent Allowance (HRA) is a portion of an employee‚Äôs salary specifically designated to cover rent expenses. It‚Äôs a tax-exempt benefit under Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act. The amount eligible for tax deduction varies based on the city of residence, the actual rent paid, and the employee‚Äôs basic salary. For instance, individuals residing in metro cities can claim up to 50% of their basic salary as HRA, while those in non-metro cities can claim up to 40%. How to Calculate HRA in Salary? When it comes to determining the portion of House Rent Allowance (HRA) that can be excluded from the taxable salary, the following HRA calculation formula is used: To calculate the HRA exemption, the least of the following values is considered: Actual HRA received by the employee. 50% of the basic salary, if the employee resides in a metropolitan city. 40% of the basic salary, if the employee resides in a non-metropolitan city. Actual rent paid by the employee minus 10% of the basic salary. HRA Calculation Formula : Actual rent paid ‚Äì 10% of basic salary = HRA Tax Exemption Amount By applying the formula mentioned above, the smallest amount among these options is considered exempt from the taxable salary. It‚Äôs important to note that individual circumstances may vary, and tax regulations can change over time. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a tax professional or refer to the latest tax guidelines to ensure accurate calculations tailored to your specific situation. HRA Calculation Example Let‚Äôs take a look at the case of Mr. Aditya, an individual living in Mumbai who is employed and receives a monthly salary. He resides in rented accommodation and pays a monthly rent of Rs.10,000, which sums up to Rs.1.2 lakh annually. Below is a table presenting the various components of his monthly earnings: Components Amount Basic Salary Rs.30,000 HRA Rs.13,000 Conveyance Allowance Rs.2,000 Special Allowance Rs.3,000 Leave Travel Allowance Rs.5,000 Total Earnings Rs.53,000 For HRA deduction calculation, let‚Äôs look at Mr. Aditya‚Äôs House Rent Allowance (HRA). We need to consider various factors based on his annual earnings: Actual HRA component of his salary: Rs.13,000 * 12 = Rs.1.56 lakh. 50% of his basic salary, as he resides in Delhi: 50% * Rs.30,000 * 12 = Rs.1.80 lakh. Actual rent paid minus 10% of basic salary: (Rs.10,000 * 12) ‚Äì (10% * Rs.30,000 * 12) = Rs.84,000. Among these options, the lowest value is Rs.84,000. Therefore, Mr. Aditya can claim a tax exemption of Rs.84,000 on his HRA. Any amount received as HRA beyond this exemption will be subject to taxation based on his income tax slab. By availing this tax exemption, Mr. Aditya can effectively reduce his taxable income and potentially lower his tax liability. It‚Äôs essential for individuals to understand the tax rules and exemptions related to their salary components to make informed financial decisions. With the Help of the Online HRA Calculator, You Can Calculate Without Anyone‚Äôs Help. Calculate HRA Now! HRA Calculator Different Ways to Calculate HRA for Various Situations 1. Rent Payments to Family Members Did you know that even if you pay rent to your family members, you can still qualify for a deduction under the House Rent Allowance (HRA)? It‚Äôs true! Even if you live with your parents, as long as you can provide proof of rental transactions, such as financial transaction records, a rental agreement, and rent receipts, you can be eligible for the HRA exemption. However, keep in mind that if you own the property or if your spouse owns it, you won‚Äôt be able to take advantage of this benefit. The property must be owned by someone other than yourself or your spouse to qualify for the HRA exemption. 2. Home Ownership in a Different City Owning a house in a different city from where you live and work doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt claim the HRA. In fact, you can still submit an HRA claim and even deduct the cost of your home loan EMIs from your taxes. This falls under the HRA exemption rule stated in Section 10(13A) of the Income-tax Act. All you need to do is provide sufficient evidence to support your claim. So, whether your home is in a different city or not, you can still enjoy the benefits of the HRA exemption. 3. Rent Sharing with Your Spouse When you and your spouse divide the expenses",

    "question": "What is Gold ETF ‚Äì Overview, Advantages, Disadvantages & How to Invest",
    "answer": "Large Cap Funds ‚Äì Meaning, Features, Advantages and DisadvantagesSeptember 30, 2022A Comprehensive Overview to Investing in Sectoral Mutual FundsOctober 3, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle A Gold Exchange-traded fund is a novel way to invest in gold without buying physical gold. Gold ETF allows investors to buy or sell gold on an exchange. Essentially what is a gold ETF is investing in the yellow metal through an exchange. Each unit of the gold ETF scheme represents1 gram of gold of the highest purity, and the unit‚Äôs price tracks the price of the gold. So the amount of investment in gold ETF means investment in the corresponding weight of gold. Are you still wondering what is gold ETF? Well, it is a passive investment based on gold that invests in physical gold and supports gold prices. In other words, gold ETFs are units that represent physical gold, and one can trade them on an exchange like any company‚Äôs stock. One unit of gold ETF represents 1 gram of gold and is backed by actual gold of the highest purity (99.5 parts) The first gold ETF was launched in India in 2007, and now almost all asset management companies have their own gold ETFs. Traditionally, gold has been an investor favourite both in India and internationally. Gold is considered a store of value and hedge against inflation, and the investment in ETF conserves these properties, in addition to the convenience of holding the precious metal in electronic form. Why Should You Invest in Gold ETFs? Investing in a gold ETF will diversify your portfolio, providing you with the benefits of investing in a different asset class, i.e., gold. In addition, it will come under passive investment and can constitute a defensive portion of your portfolio. Additionally, investment in gold is considered a hedge against inflation and sudden market fluctuations. The same holds for gold ETFs also. Investors negatively correlate the price of gold with significant currencies like the US dollar, and a fall in the US dollar can increase gold prices. Therefore, investors can hedge their exposure to the US dollar by investing in gold. Each unit of gold ETFs represents one gram of gold of the highest purity (99.5% pure). The fact makes it suitable for long-term investment, whether the investor is looking for a one-time lumpsum investment or making smaller periodic investments. Advantages of Investing in a Gold ETF a. Purity: Purity can be considered a given factor. Each unit of gold ETF represents 1 gm of gold of the highest priority. b. Convenience: As opposed to physical gold, here you would be holding the gold in dematerialized form. Keeping gold in electronic form saves a lot of hassle of storage, like security and handling. c. Ease of trading: You can buy or sell gold ETF units from your Demat account at the click of a button. Gold ETFs are much easier to liquidate in the market. d. No loads: There are no entry or exit loads in the gold ETFs. It means there is no deduction of any amount from your investment at the time of investment or during withdrawal. e. Tax benefits: Long-term investments in gold mutual funds are taxed at 20% after indexation. The long-term implies investment for more than three years. f. Pledging: One can pledge gold ETF units as collaterals for obtaining loans. Should You Invest in Gold ETF One can say that Gold ETFs are suitable for investors looking to take advantage of the long-term appreciation in gold prices. Investment in gold ETF means investment in gold in its purest form. In addition, gold ETFs are ideal for investors who do not want to invest in physical commodity gold. Gold ETFs still allow them to take advantage of rising gold prices by trading it on the exchange. Gold ETFs provide the opportunity to gain market exposure to the price and performance of the precious metal. Gold-based exchange-traded funds have given good returns in the last few years. This fact makes them a perfect investment option for conservative investors looking to invest for the long term. The expenses in gold ETFs are in the form of brokerage up to 0.5 to 1%, making them a cheaper investment option than other mutual fund schemes. It is advisable to keep the investment in Gold ETF limited to 5-10% of your portfolio to maintain the balance of risk and return in your portfolio. How to Invest in Gold ETFs Investing in gold ETF is relatively simple; you must have a Demat and trading account with a broker.

    "question": "Top 6 Credit Bureaus in India You Should Know",
    "answer": "Pre-approved Personal Loans ‚Äì What is It, Eligibility, and Document RequirementsJune 14, 2024How to Transfer Money OnlineJune 19, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle When you apply for a loan, the lenders check your credit score to determine your repayment capability. It is a three-digit numerical representation of your creditworthiness. A credit score ranges from 300 to 900. Moreover, lenders including banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) may offer competitive terms like a higher loan amount and lower interest rate if your credit score is high. This score is calculated by several credit bureaus in India. What is a credit bureau? Simply put, these are agencies that collect information related to your credit, which includes your borrowings, outstanding bills, payments, and much more. These details are then given to credit information companies that assess the credit reports and statements for various purposes like sanctioning a loan or a credit card. These agencies get the information from multiple sources, such as lenders, debt collection agencies, creditors, and public record offices. The data may also be procured from utility bills, telephone and mobile bills, and other sources. All these details are then collated into a credit report. The report can be accessed by you or lenders for a nominal fee. However, these agencies do not have any role in determining whether any loan application should be approved or not. What is the main purpose of credit bureaus? The main purpose of these agencies is to analyze financial transactions specifically related to outstanding loans and their repayments for companies as well as individuals. Based on their study, the agencies offer credit scores or ratings. These scores are an important component of the overall loan application procedure and are relied on by most financial institutions. Every lender considers the applicants‚Äô credit score while making their decisions. Know the difference between credit bureau and credit rating agency Often, people believe that a credit rating agency and credit bureau are the same. However, there is a difference between both these service providers. The former provides ratings to help investors determine the risk of investing in a particular product or lending money to an organization. The ratings are given as alphabets like AAA, BBB, CCC, and much more. On the other hand, the latter collects information on individuals and disseminates a credit report, which comprises a three-digit numerical score to the lenders. Financial institutions use the report to determine the applicants‚Äô creditworthiness to further decide if their applications should be approved or not. List of important credit bureaus in India The following are some of the top credit bureaus in India. TransUnion CIBIL TransUnion Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, is one of the most popular agencies in the country. It was established in 2000 and maintains records for more than 600 million individuals and 32 million companies. CIBIL was founded by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and later partnered with Chicago-based TransUnion International Inc. The agency uses information from the ‚ÄòAccounts‚Äô and ‚ÄòEnquiries‚Äô sections to determine the credit score. The four major factors that affect your CIBIL score include payment history, credit utilization, credit mix, and the number of inquiries. Furthermore, regular payment history, low credit utilization, a balanced mix of secured and unsecured loans, and limited inquiries positively impact your score. Experian Experian was founded in 2006 and it received its license in 2010 to operate in India. This agency is approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and compiles reports for individuals and companies. The Experian credit report records information like the type of loan, date of the loan, current outstanding balance, repayment history, and defaults (if any). It also includes any inquiries made with details like the type of loan and amount. The agency collects the data from member financial institutions, banks, and other registered credit grantors. Equifax It was established in 1899 as a retail credit company and is among the three largest bureaus in the world. It obtained its license to function as a credit rating bureau in 2010. Apart from credit scores, Equifax offers risk scores, portfolio scores, and other scores for individuals. Its ratings range between one and 999. Equifax uses several fa",

    "question": "What is Equated Monthly Installment (EMI)? ‚Äì Calculation and Why is it Important?",
    "answer": "How to Use Credit Card?August 2, 202410 Best Credit Cards in India 2025August 3, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle An Equated Monthly Installment, popularly known as EMI, is a payment made by a borrower to the lender. This payment is constant or fixed and is made on a pre-determined date every month. The EMI consists of both the interest and the principal and when paid over the course of a few years, it helps clear off the loan. Before you understand more about what an EMI is, here are a few terms that are commonly used while discussing loans. The sum of money that is borrowed is called the principal. The cost of borrowing money is known as interest, which is the amount you pay for availing of a loan. The tenure is the duration for which you take the loan. It may range from a few days or months to a few years. Moreover, the rate of interest you pay is pre-determined based on several factors. What is no-cost EMI? Largely, EMIs are paid with an interest. It is the interest that enables the financial institution to earn money on the amount they lend. However, sometimes you do not have to pay the interest on the principal. These loans are split into no-cost EMIs. These are generally offered by retailers and e-commerce marketplaces on consumer durables and electronic appliances. How does an Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) work? Remember that EMIs are not the same as variable payment plans. In the case of the former, the borrower must pay a fixed amount every month. However, in the latter, the borrower may choose to pay a higher amount based on his/her discretion. Most borrowers find the former beneficial because they know the exact EMI payment they must make every month. This helps them plan their finances in advance. Moreover, lenders rest assured that they have a reliable avenue to make a fixed amount of income every month by way of interest. How is EMI calculated? The Flat Rate Method The Flat Rate Method is popularly applied to a personal loan EMI calculation and sometimes, to auto loans as well. Under this method, it is the original principal amount that is considered for the calculation of the EMI. The interest is calculated on the principal amount, then added to the entire amount, and the sum is divided by the number of installments to be paid during the tenure of the loan. In this method, since the interest must cover the whole principal amount, the effective interest rate is much higher than the Reducing Balance Method, which puts the borrowers at a disadvantage. The Reducing Balance Method The Reducing Balance Method is applied to home mortgages, credit cards, and others. This method works differently from the Flat Rate Method. Here, the component of interest is calculated based on the outstanding principal amount and not the entire principal amount. As a result, every month, you pay a different component of interest and principal payment. Typically, the interest section of the EMI is larger in the initial stages of repayment. As the loan is repaid, this component becomes smaller, and a larger part of the installment is allocated to the repayment of the principal amount. You may use an online EMI calculator to estimate the installment amount and make an informed decision. Principal and interest rate amount calculation To calculate the amount that you are paying against the principal every month, you may use the following formula. E = P x [r x (1+r) ^ n] / [(1+r) ^ n] ‚Äì 1 where E is the EMI P is the principal loan amount r is the rate of interest n is the loan duration Once you know your EMI, you can calculate the interest component using the formula Interest component = P x r where P is the amount of principal remaining r is the periodic interest rate Now, you may calculate the principal component by subtracting the interest component from the EMI. Examples of Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) To gain a better understanding of how EMIs work, let us look at a couple of examples. Here, EMI calculation will be done based on both the Flat Rate Method and the Reducing Balance Method. Let‚Äôs say Mr. Singh wants to purchase a house. He already has some money saved up, and for the rest, he has decided to avail of a home loan. The principal amount of the loan is INR 50 lakhs, the interest rate is 7%, and the tenure is 20 years Using the Flat Rate Method Now, if you are to calculate the EMI based on this method, then you need to add the principal to the interest component and divide the final figure by the number of period",

    "question": "GST on Gold & Gold Jewellery- Overview, Calculation, Impact & Exemption 2023",
    "answer": "What is ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan)? ‚Äì How It WorksJuly 27, 2022What is XIRR in Mutual FundsJuly 27, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Goods and Services Tax (GST) is applicable to almost all goods and services in India since 2017. It was a historic move from the Government of India to bring the various tax slabs in different states under one umbrella. Gold is one of the most sought-after metals; many eyebrows were raised when the government levied GST on Gold in two different categories! The topic is widely discussed even after 5 years of implementation. So let us understand this in detail through this article! What is GST on Gold? In 2017, when GST was implemented on most commodities in India, gold was no exception. GST of 3% on the value of imported gold and 5% on the making charge of gold jewellery was imposed. This move aimed to increase the transparency of the import and export of gold; however, it had some adverse effects. The vendors started moving into the unorganized sector to escape from the increasing gold price. Under the new GST norms, banks pay 3% additional indirect tax. This tax has increased from 10% to 13%. The increase has become a deterrent for several banks and may remarkably impact the demand for gold. Hence, banks are hesitant to import gold in their account. How to Calculate GST on Gold and Gold Jewellery? GST on Gold can be calculated in two different ways to understand depth. We shall calculate GST on Gold (raw) in the first method and look at the GST on gold jewellery in the second method. Let us assume that gold is priced at Rs. 6,125 per gram today, and you want to purchase 25 grams of gold (raw). In such a case, the GST on gold would be as below: Tax Pre GST Post GST Gold price 1,53,125 1,53,125 Customs duty 10% 15,312.5 15,312.5 Service tax 1% 1,684.375 NIL GST 3% NIL 5,053.12 VAT 1.2% 2,041.46 NIL Total 1,72,163.33 1,73,490.62 But the maths changes if you would like to buy a finished gold product, that is, gold jewellery. Let us calculate the GST on 25 grams of gold jewellery. Tax Pre GST Post GST Gold price 1,53,125 1,53,125 Customs duty 10% 15,312.5 15,312.5 Service tax 1% 1,684.375 NIL GST 3% NIL 5,053.12 VAT 1.2% 2,041.46 NIL Making charge 10% of Gold price and customs 16,843.75 16,843.75 GST on making charge 5% NIL 842.1875 Total price 1,89,007.08 1,91,176.55 Impact of GST on Gold Before GST, the effective tax on the gold value was 2% (1% VAT and 1% service tax). With GST becoming 3%, the total price of gold has marginally increased. When one considers the GST on making charges (5%), the effective increase seen in the case above is approximately 2%. This increase is believed to be due to the country‚Äôs efforts to reduce gold imports, which help in further decreasing the nation‚Äôs current account deficit. If we view the effect of GST on gold as a seller, then the sellers in the organised sectors are the only ones affected by this government move. Even today, gold is mainly traded in the unorganised sector. Moreover, this move might give a reason for more sellers to choose the unorganised way of trade to avoid tax payment. Revised Tax Rates on Gold and Gold Jewellery Under GST As seen in the above tables, the gold and gold jewellery taxes have been revised as per the GST norms since 2017. Though the difference is not much, one can notice a slight overall increase in the metal price by the time it reaches the end-user. However, the work of multiple organisations, such as the service taxes department and the VAT department, has now been combined into one department called the GST. The move is welcome from a bureaucratic level as processes can happen faster within a department.

    "question": "What Is Unbilled Amount in Credit Card & Why Should You Track Them?",
    "answer": "What are Credit Card Cash Withdrawal Charges?December 11, 2023How to Apply for Self Employed Credit Card: 7 Best Credit Card OptionsJanuary 16, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle As a credit card user, it is important to understand the different jargon used by credit card issuers. This will help you improve your understanding of what the bank is conveying and how you should act. One of the most common terms you might have come across is the unbilled amount. The unbilled amount in a credit card is the sum of all transactions made after the credit card statement is generated. Understanding what it means can help you use credit more effectively and responsibly. What is Unbilled Amount in Credit Card? The unbilled amount on a credit card is the total of transactions made after the generation of your monthly credit card statement. Every credit card has a billing cycle, typically lasting about 30 days, after which a statement is issued detailing all transactions made during that period. Any purchases made after this statement are considered unbilled amounts. These will be added to your next monthly statement and will need to be paid accordingly. Let‚Äôs understand the unbilled amount in a credit card with an example. Suppose your credit card statement is generated on the 18th of every month. Then, it will include the transactions done from the 19th of this month to the 18th of the next month. Let‚Äôs say your credit card statement generated on 18th October has a bill of Rs. 25,000. Then, you must pay your bill before the due date, which is usually around 20 days after the bill is generated. In this case, the due date is 8th November. If you use your credit card to make a purchase of Rs. 5,000 on 19th October, then this amount will be the unbilled amount that will be included in next month‚Äôs credit card statement that will be generated on 18th November. If you spent Rs. 50,000 instead of Rs. 5,000 on 19th October and want to convert it into Equated Monthly Instalments (EMI), you must do it within 20 days of making the purchase. Otherwise, the entire amount will be included in next month‚Äôs statement. However, if you convert it into an EMI of three months, with a monthly instalment of Rs 16,973, then only this amount will be included in your next month‚Äôs bill and will be considered as the unbilled amount. The next two instalments will be due in the respective months. How to Check Unbilled Amount in Credit Card‚Äã? You can always check your unbilled amount or credit card spending before your statement is generated. By doing so, you will know how much credit you have utilized and how much is left over for the month. Following are some of the ways to check Unbilled Amount in Credit Card‚Äã before your monthly billing cycle ends. Internet Banking You can check your unbilled amount through your bank or credit card issuer‚Äôs net banking portal. To check the unbilled amount, login to your net banking account, go to the ‚ÄòCards‚Äô section, and click on ‚ÄòCredit Cards‚Äô. Select your card to check the unbilled amount, available credit balance, total credit limit, billing date, and last credit card statement. Mobile Application Similar to your net banking portal, you can login to your bank‚Äôs mobile application and check your unbilled amount. To check your unbilled amount through the mobile app, make sure you download the app on your mobile and register using your account details. SMS Alerts One of the easiest ways to check the unbilled amount is through SMS alerts. When you sign up for a credit card, you automatically give consent to receive messages from the bank regarding your credit card usage and other alerts. Whenever you use your credit card, the bank sends the details of the transaction along with the used and available limit. This way, you can check the unbilled amount without even logging into your account. Customer Service If you have no access to net banking or mobile applications, you can always contact your bank‚Äôs customer service. They will give you complete information regarding your credit card balance and statement. ATM You can check your unbilled amount even at an ATM. The process of checking the unbilled amount is similar to withdrawing money from an ATM. Visit a nearby ATM, interest your card, and enter your PIN to check your unbilled amount. Visit Your Bank This is one of the most tedious and time-consuming processes, but it will help you find out your unbilled amount. Visit your bank‚Äôs branch and submit a request to find out the unbi",

    "question": "Commodity Mutual Funds: Meaning, Types, and Benefits",
    "answer": "ELSS vs Mutual Funds: Difference Between ELSS and Mutual FundJuly 7, 2023How to Save Income Tax on Salary? Tips to Save Money on TaxJuly 10, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Thanks to technology, investing has become easier than ever. Stocks, mutual funds, and fixed-income securities have been popular choices among investors for some time now. However, another asset class that is taking precedence among investors is commodities. Commodities are physical products used as raw materials for producing goods, such as crude oil, rubber, or agricultural commodities. You can invest in commodities directly by trading on the commodity exchange or indirectly by investing in commodity mutual funds. The article covers in detail commodity mutual funds, their types, and their advantages. What Are Commodity Mutual Funds? Commodity mutual funds invest at least 95% of their assets in agricultural commodities such as coffee, livestock, food grains, and seeds and non-agricultural commodities such as oil, fuels, textiles, and chemicals. The mutual fund makes a profit when the value of these commodities goes up, and it makes a loss when the underlying commodities price goes down. How Do Commodity Mutual Funds Work? The structure of commodity mutual funds is similar to Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) or Funds of Funds (FoF). They invest in commodities through Exchange Traded Commodity Derivatives (ETCD), which are futures and options of commodities. Alternatively, they invest in companies dealing with commodities such as natural resources or agricultural commodities. This is because SEBI doesn‚Äôt allow mutual funds to invest in physical commodities directly apart from gold. The performance of a commodity mutual fund depends on the performance of the underlying commodities in the fund. This directly affects the NAV (net asset value) of the fund. If the price of the commodity rises, the NAV of the fund also rises. If the fund manager books profits, it is equally divided among all the unit holders. In case the price of the commodity falls, the NAV of the fund also falls. Features of commodity mutual funds: Wide choice: There are multiple categories and subcategories of commodity mutual funds that invest in several commodities. You can choose from a wide variety of funds to invest in for your short and long-term goals. Hedge against market volatility and inflation: Commodity mutual funds are not affected by market movements. Moreover, they are inversely related to stock market movements. Hence, they act as a perfect hedge against market volatility and protect your portfolio from downside risk. Moreover, as inflation rises, commodity prices increase; hence they are one asset class that is positively impacted by inflation. Diversification: Commodity mutual funds are a perfect tool for diversification. They help reduce the downside risk in a portfolio by hedging the market and inflation risk. Experienced fund manager: Commodity trading is different from equity trading and requires a lot of experience. Hence the fund managers managing commodity funds are very experienced and can give you significantly high returns. Returns: Commodity mutual funds give higher profits when the underlying price of commodities rises. This happens when the demand for a commodity is higher than its supply. Investing in such commodities will increase the overall return of the fund. Risks: Commodity mutual funds are not affected by volatility in equity markets, but they are not risk-free. The prices of commodities are affected by rainfall, geopolitical factors such as war, and natural disasters such as earthquakes. Types of Commodity Mutual Funds There are different types of commodity mutual funds in India. These vary based on their investment objective and investment strategy: Natural resources fund: This type of commodity fund invests in companies that have exposure to natural resources such as oil, gold, silver, and renewable energy. Natural resources fund doesn‚Äôt directly invest in natural resources but in companies that deal in these resources. So, the profit of the fund depends on the prices of natural recourses and the performance of these companies on the stock market. Basic or true commodities fund: Basic or true commodities funds invest directly in physical commodities that occur naturally, such as metals, food grains, etc. They are very risky as they are prone to fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities. However, they are quite a popular kind of commodity f",

    "question": "How to Validate Credit Card",
    "answer": "Best Investment Options ‚Äì Where to invest?August 28, 20248 Best Retirement Investment Plans & OptionsAugust 29, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle With payment flexibility and other added benefits, the use of credit cards to make online and offline transactions is increasing every day. However, the risk of fraud associated with this mode of payment cannot be denied. Businesses can face significant challenges and some serious financial consequences when accepting payments and allowing unauthorized purchases. However, with a credit card validator, the authenticity of credit card information can be verified, enabling fraud prevention. How can a credit card validator help avoid the risk of misuse and fraud related to card usage? How to validate credit card without manually verifying each detail? We have answered these and other related questions in detail in this guide. Let‚Äôs read. What is a Credit Card Validator? A credit card validator, also called a credit card checker, tests the authenticity of a credit card before a transaction. It is essential for businesses that are looking to avoid fraud and chargebacks in order to minimize financial risk. Credit card validation can be complicated with different processes and checks in place. But the goal is to ensure that the card is valid and the customer is a legitimate cardholder. This can be crucial in case of a purchase being made from a stolen card as businesses can prevent financial consequences before the transaction takes place. A credit card verifier checks the card‚Äôs structural validity, which is why many eCommerce platforms have also started using them to reduce payment errors. Why Use a Credit Card Validator? A credit card verifier is a tool specifically designed to verify credit card information and minimize revenue lost to fraud. This helps create a stable financial environment and elevates customer experiences from a security standpoint. Additionally, with a lower fraud rate, the support teams can better manage other CX-related issues and improve the overall customer service quality. A card validator also reduces potential damage to the cardholder as it flags the use of stolen or lost credit cards early in the transaction process. How Does a Credit Card Validator Work? Before investing in a card validator, you should know how to validate credit card. There are multiple layers of security when a transaction is made, and a validator verifies information using multiple components and algorithms. Personal Account Number (PAN) It is a 12-digit number unique to every cardholder. The software confirms that the PAN has a valid range and follows the expected structure. Major Industry Identifier (MII) MII is the first digit of the credit card number and indicates the card issuer‚Äôs industry. A credit card validator checks if this digit matches the issuing industry. Luhn Algorithm Also known as the ‚Äòmodulus 10‚Äô or ‚Äòmod 10‚Äô algorithm, this mathematical formula performs a series of calculations to check the compliance of the card number with the expected checksum. Checksum Authentication The checksum validation takes into account the last digit of the card number. The integrity of the entire card number is validated by the preceding digits. The validator then recalculates and checks if the checksum matches the provided digits to confirm whether or not the card number is valid. Types of Credit Card Validators Now that you know how to validate credit card, here are the types of validators you must check out: Luhn Algorithm Validator This type of credit card validator runs the credit card number through the Luhn algorithm to check its mathematical validity. If the number matches the expected structure and digits, the card is verified. Issuer Identification Number (IIN) Validators IIN validation includes verification of the first six digits of the credit card number by comparing them to a valid IIN database. This validator confirms the card‚Äôs issuer. IIN validators are also known as BIN (Bank Identification Number) validators. Card Verification Value (CVV) Validators CVV validators verify credit card CVV and facilitate the processing of transactions. This validator, however, does not determine if the card is currently active. Address Verification Service (AVS) Validators These tools check the address details during the transaction. The billing address should match the data recorded by the issuing bank. Expiration Date Validators This validator checks the card‚Äôs expiration date to preve",

    "question": "Portfolio Diversification: Types, Strategies, Benefits & Limitation",
    "answer": "NPS vs PPF: A Comparision Between the Two Popular Government SchemesJune 27, 2023Mutual Fund Diversification: Meaning, How it Works, and AdvantagesJune 27, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle One commonly used phrase in investing is ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt put all the eggs in one basket‚Äô. This means you have to spread your investments across asset classes and securities to reduce the risk of investing. This is known as diversification. It is a risk management technique used to reduce the downside risk in a portfolio and increase long-term returns. What is Portfolio Diversification? Diversification or portfolio diversification is a strategy that attempts to reduce the risk in a portfolio by spreading the investments across a wide variety of investments and asset classes. The basic idea behind investing across different investments is to reduce the downside risk and increase returns in the long term. However, it is important to note that diversification doesn‚Äôt guarantee returns, it only aims to mitigate the risk in investing. Diversification is done by spreading the investment across asset classes, instruments, industries, and geographies. In the case of asset classes, you can invest in equities, debt, gold, and real estate. With respect to diversification across instruments, there are shares, mutual funds, government securities, bonds, etc. You can also diversify by investing in securities across different industries and geographies. How Does Portfolio Diversification Help Reduce Risk in Investing? Offsets losses: With multiple asset classes in a portfolio, you are offsetting the losses of one asset class with profits from another asset class. This way, you are reducing the risk of a drastic loss in your portfolio. Hedging: By spreading your investments across instruments, asset classes, and geographies, you are less vulnerable to specific risks. For example, if you invest in debt securities of a company and it defaults on the payment, you have other securities in your portfolio to maintain the overall portfolio return. Imagine investing your entire money in the debt securities of this company. You would end up losing all your money. Since you diversified your investments, the returns from other securities are not affected. Reduces volatility: Since you invest in multiple asset classes, you have a portfolio of investments that have a low correlation to one another. This reduces the volatility and risk in the portfolio. Different Types of Portfolio Diversification There are different ways through which you can diversify your investment portfolio. Following are the different types of diversification. 1. Asset class diversification The ideal way to build an investment portfolio is to invest in different asset classes. Different assets react differently to changing economic conditions. Many asset classes move in different directions in certain situations. Take, for example, gold and equity. They move in opposite directions in many situations. Some asset classes soar during an inflationary environment, while others perform poorly. Commodities, gold, and stocks of industries such as the healthcare industry and consumer staples benefit from inflation. In contrast, consumer discretionary and construction equipment industries were affected by inflation. Hence by adding different asset classes to your portfolio, you can reduce the risk of losses. 2. Industry diversification The economy is made up of different industries, of which many are correlated, and many are not. Investing across industries will help maintain portfolio returns as losses of one industry are offset by the profits of another industry. This is because all industries move in cycles, and not all have similar cycles. In other words, when an industry is in the expansionary phase, the others might be in the contraction phase. Hence you must invest in different industries that are not correlated to ensure your portfolio is diverted. 3. Geographic diversification The world has become a global village. Travelling, shopping, and even investing across nations have become easier than before. In a world filled with developed, developing, and emerging nations, there are several investment opportunities available to you. All you have to do is invest in securities across different nations to reduce the country and currency risk in your portfolio. 4. Strategy diversification There are several investment strategies that are used by experts to build a portfolio. Some of them are growth, value, incom",

    "question": "Gold Loan vs Personal Loan ‚Äì Which is Better & Why?",
    "answer": "How to Get a Personal Loan on Low CIBIL Score?September 26, 2024How to Get an Instant Personal Loan Without Income Proof?September 26, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle When you‚Äôre in need of immediate funds, taking out a loan is often one of the most practical solutions. In India, two popular loan options that many consider are gold loans and personal loans. Both can offer quick access to cash, but they cater to different financial needs and come with varying terms. If you‚Äôre wondering which loan is better suited to your situation, it‚Äôs important to understand how they differ. From the type of collateral required to interest rates, repayment periods, and eligibility criteria, each loan option has its own advantages and limitations. This article will guide you through the major differences between gold loans and personal loans, helping you evaluate which one aligns with your financial needs and long-term goals. Gold Loan vs Personal Loan ‚Äì Which is Better? Let‚Äôs begin by breaking down the differences between a gold loan and a personal loan. Below is a table summarising the key aspects: Criteria Gold Loan Personal Loan Loan Amount Determined by the value of pledged gold Based on income, credit score, and repayment ability Collateral Required (gold as security) No collateral required Tenure Short to medium-term, typically up to 5 years Short to medium-term, typically between 1 to 5 years Interest Rates Lower, usually ranging from 7% to 15% Higher, typically from 10% to 24% Eligibility Easier, no credit score necessary Dependent on credit score and income stability Processing Time Quick, often approved within hours Can take a few days to process Documentation Minimal, only proof of gold ownership required Extensive, including proof of income, identity, etc. Repayment Options Flexible (EMI, bullet repayment, overdraft) Fixed EMIs Fees and Charges Lower fees (e.g., processing, valuation) Higher fees, including processing and late payment fees Foreclosure/Prepayment Charges Usually low or none May incur higher charges for prepayment or foreclosure On Defaulting Gold may be confiscated by the lender Can damage credit score, leading to legal consequences What is Gold Loan? A gold loan is a type of secured loan where you use your gold jewellery or coins as collateral to borrow money. It‚Äôs a straightforward process: lenders assess the purity and weight of your gold, and based on that, they offer you a loan amount. This option is particularly appealing for those who need quick cash but want to keep their assets. You get the funds you need while still holding onto your gold. Advantages of Gold Loan Quick Access to Funds: One of the biggest perks of a gold loan is the speed of disbursal. You can often get the money you need in just a few hours, making it perfect for emergencies. Lower Interest Rates: Since it‚Äôs a secured loan, the interest rates are generally more favourable compared to unsecured loans. This can save you money in the long run. Flexible Repayment Options: Many lenders offer various repayment plans, so you can choose what works best for your financial situation. No Credit History Needed: If you have a low credit score or no credit history at all, a gold loan can still be an option, as it relies on the value of your gold rather than your creditworthiness. Retain Ownership of Your Gold: You don‚Äôt have to sell your gold to get cash. Once you repay the loan, your gold is returned to you. What is Personal Loan? A personal loan is an unsecured loan that gives you the freedom to use the funds for almost anything- be it a home renovation, a family vacation, or consolidating debt. Since personal loans don‚Äôt require collateral, they can be an attractive option for those who prefer not to tie up their assets. The loan amount you can receive usually depends on your income and creditworthiness. Advantages of Personal Loan Unsecured Financing: The fact that personal loans are unsecured means you don‚Äôt have to risk your assets. This can provide peace of mind while borrowing. Versatile Use: You can use a personal loan for a range of purposes, which adds a level of flexibility that other types of loans might not offer. Fixed Interest Rates: Many personal loans come with fixed interest rates, allowing you to plan your monthly payments without worrying about fluctuations. Build Your Credit: Successfully managing a personal loan can help boost your credit score, paving the way for better borrowing options in the future. If you‚Äôre looking ",

The fund manager invests your money in stocks and securities after thorough market research. They either make investing decisions independently, take your consent for every transaction, or provide advisory services and you will have to execute the transactions on your own. They provide their services for a fee, which is usually a percentage of the investment amount or a cut in profits. The fund manager also customizes the portfolio based on your financial goals, risk appetite, and investment tenure. What are Mutual Funds? Mutual funds are investments that pool money from several investors and invest in stocks and securities based on the fund‚Äôs objective. A fund manager takes all the decisions regarding the portfolio independently, and the investors have no say in it. They perform extensive market research before choosing the securities for the portfolio and charge a small fee from the investors. Mutual funds are governed by the securities and exchange board of India (SEBI) and must make daily and monthly disclosures. Several kinds of mutual funds are available in the market, and investors can choose based on their financial goals, investment tenure and risk appetite. Benefits of PMS Professional management: In PMS, an experienced fund manager handles your portfolio. They understand how to handle a portfolio in different market conditions and manage your investments efficiently to increase returns over time. Customized portfolio: Fund managers customize the portfolio according to your goals, risk tolerance levels, investment horizon, and age. They will factor in all these before choosing securities for your portfolio. Transparency: As an investor in a PMS fund, you can get complete information about all transactions. You can also know the status of the portfolio and its holdings anytime you want and not wait for monthly, quarterly, or half-yearly updates from the fund house. Regular monitoring: The fund manager will monitor your portfolio closely and monitor its performance. If they find any deviation, then they will alter the portfolio immediately. Benefits of Mutual Funds Low minimum investment: You can start investing in mutual funds with just Rs 500. You don‚Äôt need a huge amount to invest in them. Multiple modes of investment: You can invest in mutual funds either in lumpsum or regularly through a systematic investment plan (SIP). Based on your requirements, you can choose one of the two options. Transparency: The fund house is required to release the net asset value (NAV), expense ratio, portfolio holdings, and any other disclosures regularly. This ensures transparency in your investments. Diversification: You can access an entire basket of stocks and securities by investing in one mutual fund. This ensures your portfolio is well diversified across multiple securities. Professional management: Mutual funds are managed by professionals. They are well experienced and experts in their fields who know how to handle a portfolio in different market situations. Differences between PMS Funds & Mutual Fund Following are the major differences between PMS funds and mutual funds. Investment amount The minimum investment amount in a mutual fund is Rs 500 through SIP, whereas for PMS, the minimum ticket size is Rs 50 lakhs. Hence mutual funds are easily accessible to all investors, unlike PMS funds. Fees Mutual funds charge a fixed expense from their investors, which is directly cut from the fund‚Äôs NAV. Investors are not liable to pay any taxes on individual transactions. In contrast, PMS charges a fixed fee or a p",

    "question": "What Is Fixed and Variable Salary? Meaning, Differences and Ways to Calculate Your Salary",
    "answer": "Salary Certificate Format in Word and PDF: Free Downloadable TemplateApril 8, 2025Salary Increment Letter: Free Download, Writing Format & TemplatesApril 9, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle As an employee, it‚Äôs important to understand the different components of your income statement and one of the most critical terms is ‚Äúbasic salary.‚Äù This is the foundation of your earnings, the amount you receive before any adjustments are made for taxes, bonuses, allowances, or other factors. In India, salary and pension are fundamental rights protected by the Constitution, so it‚Äôs essential to have a clear understanding of your basic salary and how it affects your overall compensation package. By taking the time to understand this concept, you can make more informed decisions about your career, negotiate better terms with your employer, and plan for a more secure financial future. What is Fixed Salary? Fixed salary is a compensation structure that many companies offer their employees. This type of pay is a guaranteed monthly salary that does not vary based on hours worked or individual performance. It includes basic pay and additional allowances like housing, childcare, or transport. While there are some advantages to this type of pay structure, there are also several disadvantages to consider. Advantages of Fixed Salary The advantages of Fixed Salary are: Consistency: Employees like the stability of knowing what their paycheck will be each month, which can lead to less financial stress and greater peace of mind. Simpler Payroll Processing: With fixed pay, calculating payroll is easier since the amount paid to employees remains the same each month. No Need to Calculate Overtime: Fixed pay doesn‚Äôt require employers to calculate overtime since employees receive the same amount regardless of hours worked. Attracting and Retaining Talent: Including allowances in the fixed pay package can help attract and retain talented employees. Disadvantages of Fixed Salary The Disadvantages of Fixed Salary are: No Incentive for Better Performance: Since the amount of pay remains the same, fixed pay doesn‚Äôt incentivize employees to perform better or work harder. Low-performing Colleagues: Employees may become unhappy when they see low-performing colleagues receiving the same pay as high-performing ones. Allowances Affecting the Bottom Line: Including allowances in the fixed pay package can affect the employer‚Äôs bottom line and profitability. How to Calculate Fixed Salary? Employed individuals need to understand that their Fixed pay forms a crucial component of their salary structure, as it serves as the basis for calculating various benefits such as PF and gratuity. Typically, companies utilize straightforward formulas to determine an employee‚Äôs Fixed salary. Annual Fixed Salary = Monthly Fixed Salary X 12 Months However, determining the Fixed wage can vary across companies and there is no fixed method to calculate Fixed salary. Generally, a reversed calculation approach is employed where a percentage of the salary and CTC (Cost to Company) is deducted to arrive at the Fixedwage. Typically, the basic pay constitutes around 40% of the gross income or approximately 50% of an individual‚Äôs CTC (Cost to the Company). Several alternative methods exist for calculating basic pay. One such straightforward formula is: Basic Salary = Gross Pay- Total Allowances or Basic Salary = Percentage of the CTC or Gross Pay Some examples to get a better idea: Let‚Äôs consider this as a salary chart of a person named Anuj. Components Amount Gross Pay ‚Çπ25,000 Basic Salary 40% of gross pay (basic salary calculation formula 1) Basic Income ‚Çπ10,000 Now let‚Äôs take this as a salary chart of an individual named Noopur. Components Amount Gross Pay ‚Çπ50,000 Basic Salary 50% of the CTC (basic salary calculation formula 2) Basic Income ‚Çπ25,000 Tax on Basic Salary Basic salary is a crucial component of an employee‚Äôs overall compensation package. It is subject to taxation and should ideally not exceed 40% of the cost to the company. While keeping a basic salary low can lead to reduced benefits and allowances, an excessively high basic salary can attract a heavier tax burden for the employee. This is why employers and employees alike must strike a balance and ensure that the basic salary is set at a reasonable level. Interestingly, the basic salary amount can vary based on the employee‚Äôs level of seniority, with junior employees typically receiving a higher basic salary compared to their ",

    "question": "Difference Between Shares And Debentures",
    "answer": "ULIP vs Mutual Funds: Which is a better investment?September 25, 2023Difference Between REIT and InvIT? Meaning and Types in DetailOctober 5, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Every business requires capital to operate and expand. It can source its capital from the company‚Äôs promoters or shareholders or through debt. When a company raises money from its owners, they are offered a right to participate in the company‚Äôs profits by way of equity shares. On the other hand, when the company borrows money by issuing securities such as debentures or bonds, it is raising money through debt. Although both are different forms of raising capital, they are very different from each other. In this article, we will highlight the difference between equity shares and debentures in detail. What are equity shares? Equity shares, also known as stock, represent ownership of a company. When a company raises money from the market, it is diluting its ownership. It will issue equity shares to the proportion of the money it receives. The person who holds these shares are known as equity shareholders. Equity shareholders are entitled to receive a share in the company‚Äôs profits to the extent of shares held by them in the form of dividends. They can also participate in the company‚Äôs critical decisions, such as the appointment of a director or merger or acquisitions, through voting rights. A company issues equity shares primarily to expand and run the business. It either issues shares privately or through a public offering, which is popularly known as an IPO or initial public offering. When a company issues shares for the first time to the public, it does so through an IPO. You can become a shareholder of a company by subscribing to the IPO or purchasing the shares from the stock exchange. When shares are listed on the stock exchange, the price of the share fluctuates based on market demand and supply. If the demand is more, it implies people are buying more, so the price of the share rises. In contrast, if the supply is more, then people are selling the share more, so the price of the equity share falls. Hence, when you buy shares of a company, you are benefitting from the dividend and the capital appreciation. Types of equity shares Following are the different types of equity shares in the market. Ordinary shares: Shares that the company first issues through an IPO are known as ordinary shares. Bonus shares: When a company issues additional shares to the shareholders from its retained earnings, it is called a bonus issue, and the shares that are issued are known as bonus shares. Rights shares: Shares that are only issued to premium shareholders at a discounted rate to raise additional capital to run the company are known as rights shares. Sweat equity: When the directors or key employees receive shares at a discount in exchange for their extraordinary performance or contribution to the company, then the shares are known as sweat equity. Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP): Companies issue shares to employees as a retention strategy and also as a form of compensation for the work done by them. Employees who exercise their ESOP will own the shares of the company. What are debentures? Debentures are securities a company issues to borrow funds from the market. They are long-term debt instruments that are issued under the seal of a company. The debenture holders are creditors to the company and are entitled to interest. When the debenture expires, the company must pay back the principal amount (borrowed funds) along with the interest to the debenture holders. Debentures are unsecured loans, so the company doesn‚Äôt provide any collateral when they issue debentures. Companies usually prefer the debenture route when they have already pledged all their assets and shares and need more money to raise capital. Debenture holders do not carry any voting rights and, hence, do not have a say in the company‚Äôs operations. Moreover, they are not eligible to participate in the company‚Äôs profits and hence don‚Äôt receive dividends. However, they receive an interest which is paid on a regular basis or directly at the time of maturity of the debenture. If the company goes for liquidation, debenture holders have the first preference over the company‚Äôs assets and funds. Credit rating agencies rate debentures of public companies, and hence, before buying a debenture from the stock exchange, you can check the creditworthiness of the company. A debenture with a high rating implies ",

Compounding is the process where your principal amount and the interest earned on it start earning more interest over time. This means you‚Äôre not just earning interest on your initial amount, but also on the interest that accumulates. People often refer to this as ‚Äúinterest on interest.‚Äù Compounding can happen at different intervals, such as daily, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. The more frequently compounding occurs, the faster your investment grows. For example, an investment that compounds twice a year will grow more than one that compounds only once, and compounding four times a year will lead to even higher growth. To find out how much an investment will grow with compounding, you can use this formula: FV = P [(1 + r/n)^(n*t)] Here‚Äôs what the terms mean: FV is the future value of your investment. P is the initial amount you invested (the principal). r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form). n is the number of times the interest is compounded in a year. t is the number of years the money is invested for. Example Let‚Äôs say you invest ‚Çπ10,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded monthly, for 3 years. In this case: P = ‚Çπ10,000 r = 0.05 n = 12 (monthly compounding) t = 3 years Plug these values into the formula: FV = 10,000 [(1 + 0.05/12)^(12*3) After solving, you‚Äôll find that the future value of your investment will be ‚Çπ11,616. This shows how compounding can help your money grow over time, depending on how often the interest is added and for how long you keep the investment. How Does Compounding Impact Investment Returns? Compounding plays a significant role in growing your investments over time. The process works by reinvesting the returns from your initial investment so that over time, you earn returns not just on your original amount but also on the accumulated gains. The longer your money stays invested, the more it benefits from compounding, resulting in a larger overall amount. Here are some ways compounding impacts investments: Building Wealth Over Time: Compounding helps you accumulate a considerable amount of wealth by multiplying your returns over the years. Staying invested for a long time gives your money the chance to grow exponentially. Closing Gaps in Financial Goals: If you are working towards a specific financial target, compounding can help make up for shortfalls. By reinvesting your returns, you can reach your goals without needing to invest significantly larger sums upfront. Keeping Up with Inflation: Over time, inflation reduces the purchasing power of money. Investments that grow through compounding can outpace inflation, helping your wealth grow despite rising costs. This makes compounding a powerful tool for preserving and increasing the value of your money over time. How Does Compound Interest Work in Mutual Funds? Compounding basically means earning interest on interest. Mutual funds are marketable securities, and their returns depend on market movements. They don‚Äôt give a fixed interest to investors. Then why do people say the power of compounding in mutual funds helps you grow wealth in the long term? Do mutual funds give compound interest? Read to find out about compounding in mutual funds. Before understanding compounding in mutual funds, we need to understand mutual fund returns. While there are various types of mutual fund returns, the following two are the most commonly used. Absolute returns Absolute returns are basically the profit you make on selling goods. It is simple to calculate and tells by how much your investment has grown, irrespective of the time period. Absolute return = ((Final value ‚Äì initial investment)/(Initial investment))*100 Absolute returns don‚Äôt change irrespective of the time period. Hence it gets difficult to compare the absolute returns of two investments. Let‚Äôs understand this with an example. Suppose you invest Rs 10,000 in two funds, Fund A and Fund B. Fund A grows to Rs 15,000 in 3 years, and Fund B grows to Rs 18,000 in 5 years. The return from Fund A and Fund B is 50% and 80%, respectively. Fund B gave you good returns, but it took five years, and Fund A gave you a 50% return in just three years. You cannot compare these two funds because you don‚Äôt know which fund made you better returns in a short period. This",

    "answer": "Difference between IPO and FPOSeptember 12, 2024Best Credit Cards for Beginners in IndiaSeptember 12, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Misplacing a credit card or fearing it‚Äôs being misused can be incredibly stressful. It‚Äôs crucial to act swiftly to block the card and stop any potential fraud. In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through the process of blocking your credit card, offer advice on safeguarding it from fraud, explain how to unblock it, explore common reasons for card blocks, and address some of the most frequently asked questions. How to Block a Credit Card A credit card is the most useful financial tool for managing your finances. With this extra credit limit, you can smoothly navigate through your monthly purchases. While you can read about RuPay credit cards in detail, there can be times when you may have to block your credit card for several reasons. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you with this process: 01 Through the Mobile App Here‚Äôs how to block your credit card with the help of the bank‚Äôs mobile application: Open your credit card provider‚Äôs mobile app. Navigate to the credit card section. Select the option to block your card. Follow the app‚Äôs prompts to confirm your selection. 02 Through Internet Banking Follow the steps for blocking your credit card with the help of internet banking: Sign in to your online banking account. Go to the ‚ÄúCredit Cards‚Äù section. Choose the option to block your card. Complete the process by following the on-screen instructions. 03 Through Phone Call your card provider‚Äôs customer service helpline. Follow the prompts given by the automated voice system. Choose the option to block your credit card. Provide the required verification details when asked. 04 Through the Bank Branch Find the nearest branch of your credit card provider. Visit the branch during business hours. Speak with a customer care representative about your lost or stolen card. Fill out the necessary paperwork and present any required identification to have your credit card blocked. How to Unblock a Credit Card If you need to unblock your credit card, you can use the same methods mentioned earlier for blocking your card. These include calling customer support, accessing your bank‚Äôs online portal, sending an email, or visiting the bank in person. Reasons Why a Credit Card Can Get Blocked There are several reasons why your card may get blocked. Here are some of the main ones: 01 Theft or Loss One of the primary reasons you might need to block your credit card is if it has been lost or stolen. Additionally, to protect your financial security, your bank may proactively block your card if any unusual activity is detected. In such situations, you‚Äôll need to request a replacement card, which can typically be done through the bank‚Äôs online app or official website. Ditch the Plastic, Ditch the Worry Secure Your Money with Jupiter‚Äôs Digital Credit Card Apply Now! 02 Irregular Payment If your bank notices that you‚Äôve been inconsistent with paying your credit card bills, they may block your card. To regain access, you‚Äôll need to settle the outstanding balance promptly. Fortunately, many banks allow you to unblock your card by paying just the minimum amount due, leaving the rest to be paid by the next due date. But be warned: if you default more than four times, your card could be permanently blocked and rendered invalid. To settle the debt, you‚Äôll need to pay off the entire outstanding amount. Even then, the likelihood of getting your card reactivated is slim. 03 Credit Limit Over-Utilisation When you get a credit card, your bank assigns you a maximum spending limit. It‚Äôs generally recommended to keep your spending between 60% and 70% of that limit to maintain a good credit score. However, if you max out your credit card, your bank might block it. To unblock your card in such cases, you‚Äôll need to pay off the entire outstanding balance. 04 Suspicious Activity Credit card providers keep an eye on transactions to spot any unusual patterns or suspicious behaviour. If they suspect fraudulent activity, they may block your card as a precaution to safeguard you from potential fraud. 05 Non-Compliance to KYC Rules Since banks and their customers engage heavily in borrowing and lending, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has established stringent guidelines for both sides. These Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations are designed to protect your personal data and ensure clarity in the relationship between banks and credit card holders. ",

    "question": "10 Different Types of Credit Card in India",
    "answer": "How to Transfer Money From Credit Card to Bank Account‚Äã?August 7, 2024What Is Outstanding Amount in Credit Card?August 7, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle The credit card market offers a wide variety of options, which can be overwhelming. To choose the right card, begin by assessing your needs and how you plan to use your credit card. By understanding your requirements and usage scenarios, you can make a more informed decision. In this blog, we‚Äôll explore the different types of credit card to help you find the one that best suits your needs. Let‚Äôs dive in. Different Types of Credit Card 01 Travel Credit Cards Travel credit cards let you earn rewards for travel expenses like airline tickets and hotel stays. They often come with additional perks, such as travel insurance, priority services, and access to airport lounges. Travel credit cards can be significantly different from each other. Some allow you to transfer rewards to various airline or hotel programs, while others are limited to one specific brand. Some cards also offer extra bonuses for spending in other areas like entertainment or dining. Many travel credit cards provide a bonus or a welcome benefit for opening a new account, though most charge an annual fee. Comparing the value of rewards from different travel credit cards can be challenging, as the worth of points can differ between airlines and hotels. 02 Rewards Credit Cards Rewards credit cards give you points for every purchase you make. You earn a set percentage of your purchase amount as reward points. For example, you might earn five points for every Rs. 100 spent. The points earned can differ based on the type of purchase; for instance, buying fashion accessories or shopping from clothing brands might earn you different points compared to buying groceries or dining at a premium hotel. Once you collect a certain number of points, you can browse the catalogue provided by your card issuer and choose how you want to redeem your rewards. 03 Fuel Credit Cards Fuel credit cards are designed for frequent drivers, offering benefits specifically for fuel purchases. They are ideal for those who spend a significant part of their income on petrol or diesel. The main benefits include surcharge waivers, eliminating extra fees on card payments at petrol pumps. Many fuel credit cards also reward loyal customers with free fuel or other incentives upon reaching certain spending milestones. Additional perks often include accelerated reward points on fuel purchases, cashback offers, and discounts at partner outlets. These features make fuel credit cards a valuable tool for managing fuel expenses and maximising savings. 04 Cashback Credit Cards Unlike reward points cards that require you to accumulate points and then redeem them for rewards or merchandise, cashback credit cards offer a more straightforward approach. These cards give you a fixed percentage of your spending back as instant cash credit into your account. This means you don‚Äôt have to worry about complicated point redemption systems or hidden terms and conditions. To maximise your savings, many cashback credit cards offer tiered rewards based on spending categories. This allows you to maximise your savings on the things you spend the most on. One standout cashback card in the market is the Jupiter Edge CSB Bank Credit Card. This card offers a generous 2% cashback on essential categories like travel, dining, and more, ensuring you get more value for your money. Additionally, you earn 0.4% cashback on all other spends, making it a rewarding card for everyday use. 05 Prepaid Credit Cards Prepaid credit cards offer a convenient and secure alternative to traditional credit cards. Unlike traditional credit cards that operate on a line of credit, prepaid cards function similarly to debit cards, requiring users to load money onto the card before making purchases. This eliminates the risk of accruing debt, making them a popular choice for individuals looking to manage their spending. Similar to traditional credit cards, prepaid cards can be used for both online and offline purchases. They offer the same convenience of contactless payments, online shopping, and even the ability to avail discounts and offers. Many retailers and online platforms accept prepaid cards, making them a versatile payment option for various transactions. 06 Corporate Credit Cards Corporate credit cards help keep personal and business expenses separate. They are ideal for handling business-related ",

    "question": "RBI‚Äôs E-mandate for Recurring Transactions",
    "answer": "Understanding Price Elasticity of Demand ‚Äì Examples and CalculationsAugust 8, 2024What is Credit Card LimitAugust 8, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular updating the rules for recurring payments using debit and credit cards. These changes became applicable from 1st October 2021 wherein cardholders are given the option to either approve or disapprove the transaction before it is auto debited. Most banks had intimidated their customers about the proposed changes to the rules governing auto-debit transactions. However, some cardholders still faced the hassle of failed payments during the previous month as they migrated to the new rules. What Is Recurring Payment? Before discussing the changes applicable to auto-debit transactions, let us understand what a recurring payment is. It is a payment mechanism wherein you authorize the merchants to automatically debit a predetermined amount from your account at a periodic interval, such as monthly to avail of ongoing access to goods and services.

    "question": "How PF Is Calculated? A Step-by-Step Guide",
    "answer": "Difference Between Direct and Regular Mutual FundsMay 25, 2023What is Investment Planning and Why is it Important?June 27, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Are you curious about how your retirement savings are calculated? Look no further! In this blog, we‚Äôll delve into the Employee Provident Fund (EPF), a retirement scheme designed to ensure sufficient funds for your retirement period. Regardless of whether you work in the private or government sector, you can take advantage of this scheme. Interestingly, nowadays, any company with a workforce exceeding 20 employees is required to sign up for the Provident Fund. Both employees and employers contribute to the fund, and in this article, we‚Äôll explore how PF is calculated on your monthly salary. So, let‚Äôs demystify PF calculation and get a better understanding of how PF is calculated! What Are the Components of PF Calculation? Basic Salary: This refers to the fixed portion of an employee‚Äôs compensation that forms the foundation for calculating PF contributions. Dearness Allowance (DA): DA in salary is an additional amount provided to employees to counter inflation and ensure their real income is maintained. It is also considered for PF calculation purposes. House Rent Allowance (HRA): HRA in salary is an allowance given to employees to cover their accommodation expenses. It is also included in the PF calculation. Conveyance Allowance: This allowance is given to employees to cover transportation expenses incurred during work-related travel. It is considered part of the PF calculation. Other Allowances and Special Pay: Apart from the aforementioned components, any other allowances or special pay received by employees that are subject to PF deductions will also be considered in the calculation. Exclusions from PF Calculation While the above components are included in PF calculation, there may be certain elements that are excluded, such as performance-based incentives, overtime pay, and reimbursements for medical expenses or travel allowances. Note: The provided information is for general understanding, and it is always advisable to consult the specific rules and regulations governing PF calculation in your region or organization. Divisions of Provident Fund Calculation The Provident Fund contribution is divided into two categories. Employee‚Äôs PF Contribution: For female employees, the contribution to their Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is set at 8% of their salary. However, this rate applies only for the initial 3 years of employment. After this period, the contribution percentage increases to 10-12% based on their base salary. Male employees, on the other hand, are required to contribute 8% of their overall salary to the EPF. Employer‚Äôs PF Contribution: Employers are obligated to contribute an equal amount to the EPF. This contribution is fixed at either 10% or 12% of the employee‚Äôs gross salary. It‚Äôs important to note that the contribution percentage remains unchanged for female employers. How PF is Calculated in India? Determining the amount of money be deposited into each employee‚Äôs Provident Fund (PF) account involves following certain rules. Typically, an employee‚Äôs PF account consists of two types of contributions: Employee‚Äôs contribution Employer‚Äôs contribution During PF calculation in an employee‚Äôs salary, the employee contributes 12% of their basic salary and dearness allowance (DA) each month to the Provident Fund. Additionally, the employer matches the employee‚Äôs contribution by providing around 3.67% and 8.33% towards the Employee‚Äôs Provident Fund (EPF) and Employee Pension Scheme (EPS) respectively in the employee‚Äôs PF account. Example Calculation of PF Suppose an employee‚Äôs basic salary, along with dearness allowance, is ‚Çπ15,000. In this case, the employee‚Äôs Provident Fund contribution would amount to 12% of ‚Çπ15,000, which totals around ‚Çπ1,800. On the other hand, the employer‚Äôs contribution to the Employee Provident Fund would be 8.33% of ‚Çπ15,000, equivalent to approximately ‚Çπ1,250. To calculate the employee‚Äôs contributions to the Employee Provident Fund, we subtract the employee‚Äôs contributions to the Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme (EPS) from the employer‚Äôs contributions. In this scenario, the difference amounts to around ‚Çπ550. Consequently, the monthly total contribution to the Employee Provident Fund becomes ‚Çπ1,800 + ‚Çπ550, resulting in ‚Çπ2,350. Considering the rate of interest for the years 2022-2023 is 8.10%, the suitable monthly interest rate for calculating int",

    "question": "Secured Credit Cards vs Unsecured Credit Cards",
    "answer": "Credit Card SkimmingSeptember 9, 2024Can I Get a Credit Card Without a Bank AccountSeptember 9, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Credit cards are known to be a blessing for managing your monthly finances and lowering some financial burden off your shoulders. However, people with low to no credit history may find it difficult to get one on favourable terms. Here‚Äôs when a secured credit card can help. But what is a secured credit card, and how is it different from an unsecured credit card? Continue reading to find out. What is a Secured Credit Card? A secured credit card is a type of credit card that requires you to make a cash deposit upfront as a form of security. The amount you deposit usually matches the credit limit you‚Äôre given. For instance, if you deposit ‚Çπ50,000 as collateral, your credit limit will generally be ‚Çπ50,000. This type of card is particularly useful for those looking to build or rebuild their credit. Because your payment activity is reported to the credit bureaus, a secured credit card gives you the chance to improve your credit score and strengthen your credit history over time. How Does a Secured Credit Card Work? Secured credit cards function much like regular credit cards, but they come with certain restrictions, particularly regarding the credit limit and other related factors. Typically, the credit limit on a secured credit card is set between 75% and 85% of your fixed deposit (FD) amount. For instance, if you have a ‚Çπ1 lakh FD, your credit card limit would likely fall between ‚Çπ75,000 and ‚Çπ85,000. Consequently, a larger FD would result in a higher credit limit on your secured credit card. Banks offer secured credit cards against FDs because the FD serves as a form of collateral. If the cardholder fails to make payments, the bank has the authority to liquidate the FD to cover the outstanding balance on the credit card. Advantages of a Secured Credit Card There are several benefits of a secured credit card, such as: Convenient Getting a credit card can be as simple as walking into a bank branch to open a fixed deposit and walking out with a card in hand. There‚Äôs no need for income verification or background checks; the documents you use for the fixed deposit also serve for the credit card application. Build a Credit History If you‚Äôve struggled with a poor credit score or have no credit history at all, a secured credit card can help you start fresh. By using the card responsibly‚Äîstaying within your limit and paying off your balance on time‚Äîyou can steadily improve your credit score. Consistent usage and timely payments are key to rebuilding your credit quickly. Once your score is healthy, you‚Äôll have more opportunities for other types of credit cards. Earn Interest on Your FD Your fixed deposit doesn‚Äôt just act as collateral; it also earns interest while it sits in the bank. Depending on the deposit term, you can accumulate a respectable amount of interest. Low Annual Fees Another advantage is that many banks in India offer secured credit cards with either low or no annual fees. Plus, the initial deposit requirement is typically affordable, with some banks asking for as little as ‚Çπ10,000, making these cards an accessible option. Considerations Before Taking a Secured Card Security Deposit: ou will have to give a security deposit initially when you get a secured card. However, this security deposit is refundable when you close your account or turn the secured card into an unsecured card. Limited Credit Limit: The credit limit of your secured credit card depends on your security deposit. This can be lower than what you expect, which is not good if you want to cover major expenses. What is an Unsecured Credit Card? Most credit cards are unsecured, meaning they don‚Äôt require you to put down a deposit as collateral. These cards typically offer better benefits, such as attractive rewards, lower fees, and more favourable interest rates. For most people, unsecured credit cards represent a more advantageous option. However, it‚Äôs understandable why someone might consider a credit card that demands an upfront cash deposit. For those with poor or no credit history, securing a traditional unsecured credit card can be extremely challenging. Without access to credit, improving one‚Äôs credit score becomes nearly impossible, making secured cards a viable alternative for building or repairing credit. Advantages of an Unsecured Card No Security Deposit Unsecured credit cards come with high interest rates, especially f",

    "question": "Everything You Need to Know About Credit Card Balance Transfer",
    "answer": "15 Best App to Pay Rent With Credit CardSeptember 12, 2024HRA in Salary ‚Äì What is It? Calculations & FormulaSeptember 13, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle So, you‚Äôve got a credit card with a balance that‚Äôs getting out of hand. Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not alone. One option is to consider a balance transfer. This means moving your debt to another credit card. Why do it? Well, some banks and financial institutions offer deals like low or even 0% interest rates for a while. This can help you save on those annoying finance charges and penalties. Let‚Äôs dive into how balance transfers work and what you need to know about them. What is a Credit Card Balance Transfer? A credit card balance transfer is a simple process that allows you to move outstanding balances from one credit card to another. Essentially, you‚Äôre taking a loan from the new card to pay off the debt on the old one. This can be beneficial if the new card offers a lower interest rate, giving you more time to pay off the debt without accruing as much interest. However, it‚Äôs important to be aware that balance transfers often come with transfer fees, so it‚Äôs crucial to weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. How to Transfer Balance from One Credit Card to Another? Transferring a balance from one credit card to another can be a useful way to manage and pay off large or overdue credit card bills. This process makes sense when the new credit card offers a lower interest rate than your current one, making it cheaper to pay off your debt. However, there‚Äôs an important point to remember: you can only transfer an amount that fits within the credit limit of your new card. For example, if your new card has a limit of Rs.50,000 and you owe Rs.75,000 on your old card, you can only transfer Rs.50,000 to the new card. To apply for a credit card balance transfer, you‚Äôll need to provide certain details and documents. These include the credit limit, the expiry date of your card, the outstanding amount, and your credit card number. Banks typically require photocopies of your credit card, recent credit card statements (usually from the last 3-6 months), and proof of address. One of the advantages of this process is that the new credit card issuer will pay off the transferred balance in full to your old card, often by issuing a demand draft. This prevents you from accumulating additional interest on your old card. The interest rate on the new card for the transferred balance is generally lower than the standard rate, but this lower rate is usually only available for a limited time. After that, the regular interest rate will apply, so it‚Äôs important to pay off the transferred balance within this period to avoid higher charges. Important Points to Remember While Using Credit Card Balance Transfer Before deciding to go for a credit card balance transfer, it‚Äôs important to understand its key aspects. Here are some important points to consider: Impact on Credit Limit When you transfer a balance from one credit card to another, your available credit limit is reduced by the amount of the transfer. For example, if your credit card limit is ‚Çπ85,000 and you transfer ‚Çπ60,000, your available limit for other purchases drops to ‚Çπ25,000. Interest-Free Period The best way to benefit from a balance transfer is to pay off the transferred amount during the interest-free or low-interest period. Once this period ends, you‚Äôll have to pay the regular interest rate that comes with a credit card, which can result in higher payments. Interest on New Purchases It‚Äôs important to note that the lower interest rate on a balance transfer doesn‚Äôt apply to new purchases made on the card. These new transactions will be subject to the standard interest rates set by the card issuer. Eligibility Criteria Balance transfer offers are typically available to customers who have held a credit card with the same company for at least a year. This ensures that cardholders don‚Äôt constantly switch from one provider to another just to take advantage of lower interest rates. Spending Strategy After transferring a balance, it‚Äôs wise to avoid using your credit card for new purchases until you‚Äôve fully paid off the balance transfer amount and cleared any additional charges. This helps prevent accumulating more debt while paying off the transferred balance. Benefits of Credit Card Balance Transfer Reduced Financial Strain Balance transfer credit cards typically have much lower interest rates compared to the regular finance charges on ",

    "answer": "Form 26AS Download ‚Äì What Is It? How You Can Download?December 16, 2024New Pension Scheme and National Pension Scheme ‚Äì Tax Benefits, Charges, and MoreDecember 17, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle As the end of the financial year comes closer, it is time to look at your tax liabilities and start preparing to file the Income Tax Returns (ITRs). Knowing about the basic rules, income tax slab rates, and exemptions can help you plan your taxes well. Income is classified under five categories, which include salary, capital gains, profession or business, house property, and other sources. All categories except capital gains are taxed at your applicable income tax slab rate. What are income tax exemptions for salaried employees? The Income Tax Act, 1961 provides several exemptions for salaried individuals. These help to reduce your taxable income and your tax liability. The provisions for tax exemptions encourage people to save more and build wealth for their financial stability. Remember that Most of the exemptions and deductions mentioned here are available for Old Tax Regime. Here are some of the income tax exemptions available if you are salaried. House Rent Allowance (HRA) ‚Äì [Section 10(13A)] If you live in a rented home, you can benefit from HRA, which is partially or fully exempted from tax. However, if you receive HRA but do not live in a rented home, the entire amount is taxable. The least of the following received as HRA in salary is exempt: Total amount received from your employer 40% of salary, which includes basic + dearness allowance (DA) for non-metros and 50% of salary for metro cities Rent paid ‚Äì 10% of basic salary + DA Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) ‚Äì [Section 10(5)] According to the Income Tax Department guidelines, you are eligible for LTA for travel expenses incurred while on leave. The exemption does not include expenses like food, shopping, leisure, and entertainment. You can claim LTA exemption two times during a block of four financial years. If you do not use the exemption during a particular block, you can carry it forward to the next block. Some of the applicable restrictions are as follows: Available only for domestic travel You should travel either by airway, railway, or public transportation system Standard deduction The standard deduction replaced medical reimbursement and transport allowance exemptions. The total amount available is INR 50,000 per year. Interest on home loan ‚Äì [Section 24(b)] Another beneficial income tax exemption for salaried employees is the interest paid on home loans. Under section 24 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, you can claim up to INR 2 lakhs as an exemption towards home loan interest for a self-occupied property. Moreover, if you rent out the property, the entire amount paid as interest is eligible for deduction. Section 80EE also allows you to claim an additional deduction of INR 50,000 paid as the home loan interest. However, it is subject to the following conditions: You should not own any other registered property in your name at the time of availing of the loan The borrowed amount should not exceed INR 35 lakhs The property value must be below INR 50 lakhs Professional tax Various states levy professional tax on employees in India. An amount of INR 2,500 is directly deducted from your salary and paid to the State Government. Professional tax is paid to the government by the employers and failing to make this payment entails penalties. Employees‚Äô Provident Fund (EPF) Companies employing 20 or more employees must contribute towards EPF on behalf of their personnel. Employers contribute 12% of the employees‚Äô salaries to EPF and other eligible funds. For the financial year (FY) 2021, the interest on these contributions is 8.50% per annum. EPF contributions reduce the taxable income and help you save the total tax payable. Food expenses Some companies may offer meal coupons to their employees. These food coupons are tax-exempt up to INR 50 per meal. Considering 22 working days and two meals per day, the benefit per month is INR 2,200 and the yearly tax exemption is up to INR 26,400. Children‚Äôs allowance As a component of your total salary, your company may provide an allowance for your children‚Äôs education. This allowance for children‚Äôs education is exempted from tax. The maximum exemption is limited to INR 1,200 per year for up to two children. Reimbursement for mobile and telephone expenses If your employer reimburses your mobile phone and residence telephone expenses,",

    "question": "Secured Loans and Unsecured Loans: Meaning, Types, and Difference",
    "answer": "Payroll Management in India: Payroll Process, Compliance & CalculationAugust 23, 2024Difference between Spending and InvestingAugust 23, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle A loan is an amount borrowed from the lenders with an agreement to repay it within a pre-determined tenure. The lenders charge a certain rate of interest on the borrowed amount. Generally, the principal and the interest amount are paid in equated monthly installments (EMIs). Banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) offer different types of loans. The two most common types are secured loans and unsecured loans. What are secured loans? These loans are secured against an asset. The lender holds the title or deed of the security until you repay the entire borrowed amount. You may use an asset like a property or vehicle to secure the loan. Alternatively, other assets like shares, fixed deposits (FDs), gold, arts, jewelry, investments, and much more can be used as collateral while availing of secured loans. Since the lender creates a lien on the pledged asset, they can repossess it if you default on the repayment. This allows them to sell the asset to recover the overdue amount. What are the different types of secured loans? Financial institutions offer several types of secured loans such as the following. Home loans These allow you to buy or construct a home. The lender sanctions up to 80% of the total value based on your income, current liabilities, age, and other factors. You may also opt for a top-up loan or home improvement finance to renovate or extend your existing home. Loan against property (LAP) You can pledge commercial, industrial, or residential property to avail of the funds. Lenders sanction between 60% and 80% of the property value, which may vary from one institution to another. There are no restrictions on how you can use this money, which means you may utilize it for meeting wedding expenses or taking a dream vacation. You may also use these funds for expanding your venture and for other business purposes. Loan against securities This type of loan allows you to capitalize your investments and pledge these to meet personal or business fund requirements. Different types of investments, such as shares, mutual funds, FDs, and bonds can be pledged to borrow money. Depending on the type of investment and other factors, lenders may sanction between 60% and 90% of its value. Gold loans For decades, people have invested in gold and the organized gold loan market has been expanding over the last few years. You may pledge your gold jewelry, coins, or biscuits as the loan collateral. Lenders will sanction a certain percent of the value as a loan. Compared to other types of finance, these are available for shorter durations and are recommended to meet short-term fund requirements. What are the advantages of secured Loans? Lower rate of interest Collateralized loans offer a lower rate of interest than unsecured ones as the risk for the lender is reduced. A lower rate can significantly reduce your total cash outflow towards interest payment over the loan duration. Higher loan amount Depending on the type of asset offered as collateral, you may borrow up to 90% of the value as a loan. This helps you meet your fund requirements without any hassles. Flexibility Lenders offer flexibility in choosing the loan tenure as per your needs. You may opt for a shorter tenure with larger EMIs or a longer duration with smaller installments. Additionally, you get convenience with features like partial prepayments, loan tenure extensions, and much more. What are the disadvantages of secured loans? Risk of loss of collateral The lenders create a lien on the mortgaged asset. They can repossess it if you fail to make repayments on time. Therefore, there is a risk of losing your asset. Impact on credit score Any delay or default on the loan is reported by the lenders to the credit rating agencies. This may negatively impact your credit score, which may make it difficult for you to qualify for another loan in the future. Cumbersome process Most lenders have complex documentation requirements, which make the procedure time-consuming and cumbersome. Additionally, you need to sign several documents and even one mismatch may further delay the procedure. Features of secured loans Loans are offered against the title of an asset Affordable rate of interest Flexible repayment options Customizable as per your requirements Quick loan approval No need for a guarantor Documents r",

    "question": "Fundamental Analysis vs Technical Analysis: Meaning and Key Differences",
    "answer": "Mutual Fund Diversification: Meaning, How it Works, and AdvantagesJune 27, 2023What Are the Benefits of PF?June 30, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle There are broadly two schools of thought when it comes to determining the price of a company. One predicts the stock price based on research, whereas the other relies on historical stock prices to forecast the future stock price. The former is fundamental analysis, whereas the latter is technical analysis. Both methods have distinct qualities and appeal to different types of market participants. This article explains in detail the meaning of fundamental and technical analysis and how they are different from each other. What is Fundamental Analysis? Fundamental analysis is a method used to determine the fair or intrinsic value of a company. It relies on the company‚Äôs fundamentals, such as revenue growth, profit growth, accounting ratios, management‚Äôs competency and business model to determine the value of its share. Apart from this, the analysis also takes into account the state of the economy and the strength of the industry to determine a company‚Äôs fair value. Once the intrinsic value of the company is determined, the analysts either mark it as overvalued or undervalued. An undervalued company‚Äôs share price is less than its intrinsic value, and an overvalued company‚Äôs share price is higher than its intrinsic value. The primary assumption behind this is that in the long term, the share price of a company will be similar to its intrinsic value. So, the price of an undervalued share will grow to reach its intrinsic value, and the price of an overvalued share will drop until it reaches its intrinsic value. Long-term investors use fundamental analysis to identify undervalued and overvalued shares so they can make buy or sell decisions on the stocks. An undervalued share makes an excellent buy, whereas an overvalued share indicates a ‚Äòsell‚Äô. Types of Fundamental Analysis There are two types of fundamental analysis that you can do to arrive at the intrinsic value; they are quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative analysis can be done using the numbers such as revenue, expenses, profit, assets, and liabilities. On the other hand, qualitative analysis is done by studying the business model of the company, its business cycles, customer base, management competency, intangible assets, and corporate governance. Quantitative analysis Financial statements are the biggest source for conducting quantitative analysis. Income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements are used to determine the financial health of a business. Following are some of the quantitative parameters to look at while doing fundamental analysis. Revenue growth: It is the primary indicator of how the business is performing. If the revenue is consistently improving, then it indicates the company is expanding its operations and attracting new customers. Profit growth: The ultimate goal for any business is to earn profits. A consistent increase in the profit and the margins indicates the company‚Äôs health is improving or stable. On the other hand, declining profits indicate falling efficiency of the business. Return ratios: Some of the important return ratios you must look at are return on equity, return on capital employed, and return on assets. These indicate how well a business is using its assets and capital to earn profits. A high and growing number indicates that the business is using its assets and capital efficiently. On the other hand, a falling number indicates otherwise. Working capital ratios: Current ratio and quick ratio are two working capital ratios that indicate the liquidity of the company. Ideally, a current ratio of 2:1 and a quick ratio of 1:1 indicate that the business is using its cash and cash equivalents correctly and has enough liquidity. However, anything less indicates that the business doesn‚Äôt have enough current assets to repay its current liabilities. Moreover, anything more than the ideal ratio indicates that the company is not using its working capital efficiently. Debt to equity ratio: A company can use debt to expand its business. However, a growing debt on the books can be a red flag. Ideally, a debt-to-equity ratio of 1x or below is considered ideal. Anything more indicates the company is overleveraged and has higher outside obligations, which affects the profitability of the company. These are just some of the many ratios used for quantitative analysis. You can use more para",

    "question": "What is Variable Pay ‚Äì All You Need to Know",
    "answer": "Tax & Inflation Effect on InvestmentJuly 23, 2024All About Gratuity ‚Äì Rules, Eligibility & CalculationJuly 26, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Are you looking to learn more about variable pay and how it works? If so, you‚Äôve come to the right place! Variable pay, also known as performance-linked pay, is a form of compensation that an employer provides to an employee based on their contribution to the organization‚Äôs growth and success. This type of pay can vary from employee to employee and may be tied to specific performance metrics or goals. But what exactly is variable pay? What are its benefits, and how does it help companies to remain competitive? In this article, we‚Äôll answer all these questions ‚Äì and more ‚Äì to provide you with a complete understanding of what variable pay is, and why it‚Äôs so important. What is Variable Pay? Variable pay is a type of Remuneration that is based on an employee‚Äôs performance. When an employee meets or exceeds their monthly target, they are eligible to receive variable pay, which can take the form of incentives, bonuses, or commissions added to their basic salary. The basic wage remains fixed and is paid regardless of target achievement, and the combination of the basic salary and variable pay is referred to as the pay mix. The amount and type of variable pay an employee receives depend on both their own performance and the company‚Äôs overall performance. If a company experiences a loss, for example, employees may not receive the applicable bonus. Therefore, companies often set a target achievement scale and base payouts on the results. Additionally, factors such as team performance and project completion can also affect the pay scale. Typically, a company will inform an employee of their achievement and the applicable variable pay, which may be provided in the form of stock, gifts, cash, or paid vacations, among other things. It‚Äôs important for employees to be aware that the variable pay they receive can vary greatly depending on their own performance, as well as that of the company and their team. Who Gets Variable Compensation in an Organization? The individuals who are eligible to receive variable compensation in an organization can vary depending on the specific company and its policies. In general, variable compensation is typically offered to employees who directly contribute to the success of the organization, such as salespeople, managers, and executives. These individuals may be rewarded based on their individual performance, team performance, or the overall performance of the company. Some companies may also offer variable compensation to other types of employees, such as those who work in production or customer service, depending on their role and the impact they have on the organization‚Äôs success. The specific criteria and eligibility requirements for variable compensation are typically outlined in an employee‚Äôs contract or through the company‚Äôs compensation policies. What Are the Types of Variable Pay Plans? 1. Bonuses Variable compensation in the form of bonuses is typically based on employee performance and the company‚Äôs overall performance. Unlike incentives, the criteria for receiving a bonus are typically not disclosed to the employee in advance. Bonuses are often unexpected and may be given to individual employees, a team, or the entire workforce. The amount of the bonus is typically determined by management and can come in various forms, such as a signing bonus, spot bonus, annual bonus, or holiday bonus. Employers may provide bonuses in the form of money or equity. Some companies may offer a higher percentage of the bonus with a lower base salary to help reduce operational costs. At the time of joining, employees may be able to negotiate the specifics of their bonuses, such as choosing between a smaller or larger variable component. Moreover, companies may incentivize their employees to refer potential candidates by offering referral bonuses to those who successfully refer someone that gets hired by the company. 2. Sales Commissions Sales commissions are a common type of variable pay plan where employees receive a percentage of the sales revenue they generate. This type of plan is typically used in industries such as real estate, insurance, and retail where employees are directly responsible for generating sales. This plan motivates sales staff to sell more and to sell better, as their earnings are directly tied to their sales performance. Sales commissions can be ",

    "question": "What is Liquidity? Financial Liquidity Definition",
    "answer": "E-Aadhaar Password Format Explained: How to Access and Open Your e-Aadhaar PDFAugust 27, 2024What Is UAN and How Do You Generate It Online?August 27, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Quite often, you may have heard people say, ‚ÄúOh, I have liquidity problems right now. I cannot really buy this house.‚Äù If you are wondering what they mean by this, let us help you understand. Read on! What is liquidity? Simply put, liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without losing its market value. Think of cash‚Äîit is the most liquid asset. Similarly, short-term securities and other financial instruments are also highly liquid assets because they can be sold for cash. If you were to imagine a liquidity spectrum, cash would be on one end, and on the other end, you would find illiquid assets like property or an estate. These are relatively more difficult to convert into cash. Why is liquidity important? For an asset to be deemed liquid, it requires a ready market. There is always a market for cash, and therefore, it is the most liquid asset today. If this was not the case, and if markets were not liquid, then selling or converting your assets or securities to cash would be an ordeal that you would not want to go through. Let us assume that you are in need of cash and want to sell your securities in the market. If you had no buyers, then the value of your securities would be of no relevance because there would be no one willing to pay that particular value. In other words, your securities would be illiquid. Whether you are an individual or a business, it is imperative that you hold a sufficient value of liquid assets so you can cover your short-term dues like bills and other overheads. If you fail to do so, you may face a liquidity risk, which if gone unattended, may even lead to bankruptcy. What is financial liquidity? Financial liquidity indicates the effort it takes to convert your assets into cash. Like we already discussed, if you hold liquid assets like bonds and stocks, these can be converted into cash in a matter of a few days. On the other hand, if you are an individual or a business with large assets like property and plant and machinery, then you must be prepared to wait before you get their value in cash. When you are planning an investment, you must always consider its financial liquidity. This is because you do not want to put all that you have into illiquid assets and expose yourself to liquidity risk. At the same time, you must also hold assets that can be used to raise funds (through a bank loan) or sold later, for instance, during your retirement. A balance of both liquid and illiquid assets is always better. Now, let us look at this in detail. Importance of liquidity in financial planning As we mentioned earlier, you must factor in the liquidity of your assets during financial planning. This will ensure that you easily meet both your short-term and long-term needs. At the same time, you will not need to rely completely on your long-term investments when you know that you have liquid assets to fall back on. However, here are two rules to follow. Have a cash reserve No matter how many assets you have, it is important to have some cash that you can instantly access. Moreover, when you hold cash, the value of these funds stays intact unlike with other assets where there is a loss in value during conversion. Now, you might wonder how much cash you must hold. While this is a personal decision and may differ from one individual to another, we recommend that you have at least three months of your take-home salary. However, if you need to use this for an emergency, remember to reload or restore the amount. Keep a healthy split It is advisable to maintain a 60:40 ratio between your liquid assets and illiquid ones. The former could comprise bonds, stocks, or other liquid funds. In essence, these will help you in times of emergencies and when you need something to encash quickly. If you are considering other investments, especially those that are publicly traded, then go for the long term because that will have a minimum impact on the price. If you are going for private investments, then consider keeping a portion of it easily accessible. You might wonder how to differentiate between these liquid assets and illiquid assets. Well, it‚Äôs quite simple. Read on to know more. What are liquid and illiquid assets? As the name suggests, liquid assets can be easily converted into cash. Some liquid assets‚Äô example",

    "question": "ULIP vs Mutual Funds: Which is a better investment?",
    "answer": "Best Time to Buy & Sell Mutual Funds in IndiaSeptember 8, 2023Difference Between Shares And DebenturesSeptember 25, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle The investing world has a plethora of investments available in the market. Of all the investments, the two most popular ones among retail investors are mutual funds and Unit Linked Investment Plans (ULIPs). Although very different, these two compete for a significant portion of your wallet. So, let‚Äôs compare ULIP vs. mutual funds and understand the advantages and limitations of each. What is a ULIP? ULIP is Unit Linked Investment Plan ‚Äì a financial instrument that combines life insurance with investments. The scheme allows you to avail insurance benefits while helping you accumulate wealth for your long-term goals. When you pay a premium, it is divided into two parts: one goes towards the insurance premium, and the other goes towards various financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and government securities. Features of ULIP Life cover: ULIP allows you to secure the financial future of your family by providing term insurance. You can select the sum insured based on your need. Investment: Apart from providing you insurance, the scheme allows you to invest in financial securities, much like mutual funds. You can select the type of plan you invest in, and you have the flexibility to switch between funds to match your changing needs. Premium paying options: ULIPs have multiple premium paying options, such as single, monthly, half-yearly, or yearly. You can choose the one that will match your resources and goals the best. Top-ups: As your income increases, you can increase your premium payments as well through the top-up option. This top-up will be an additional investment over the existing investment. Partial withdrawal: If you need money to fund an emergency, you can partially withdraw from your ULIP plan after five years. However, there is a limit on the number of withdrawals and the amount you can withdraw. Advantages of ULIP Dual benefits: ULIPs provide the dual benefits of an insurance policy and an investment. With just one financial instrument, you can fulfil both your insurance and investment needs. Tax exemption: The premium you pay for your ULIP plan qualifies for tax deduction under Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The maturity benefit is also tax-free under Section 10 (10 D). Fund switching: In ULIPs, you can not only choose the type of funds you want to invest in, but you can also switch between funds without any additional charges or costs. This feature of ULIPs will help you switch when your goals are nearing or the market is very volatile. In such cases, you can switch from equity to debt and then again back to equity. Limitations of ULIP Expense ratio: ULIPs have a lot of expenses associated with them. They charge administration charges, fund management charges, switch charges, surrender charges, mortality charges, premium allocation and withdrawal charges from you. They deduct all these charges before investing in a fund of your choice. Hence, your total investment comes down by a substantial amount. Lock-in period: ULIPs have a lock-in period of five years. Hence, you cannot withdraw your money before this tenure. Even if you surrender your policy before five years, you will have to wait until five years to get back your money. Market volatility: ULIPs invest in marketable securities and hence are exposed to market volatility. In the initial years, the return from them is low or even negative. However, in the long term, they give decent returns. Complex instrument: ULIPs are a complex instrument as they are both an insurance and investment product. It can get difficult to keep track of the premium and NAVs (net asset value) of the fund, along with switching, redirecting, and investing decisions to maximise your gains. What is a mutual fund? Mutual funds are the most popular financial instruments. They pool money from several investors who have a similar objective and invest in marketable securities such as shares, bonds, debentures, and government securities. There are various types of mutual funds based on market capitalisation, asset type, duration, and risk factors. Hence, investors have a wide variety to choose from. Mutual funds are managed by professional fund managers who decide the asset allocation and the securities for the fund after doing thorough research. They strive to make profits for the investors, which is automatically reflected",

    "question": "A Comprehensive Overview to Investing in Sectoral Mutual Funds",
    "answer": "What is Gold ETF ‚Äì Overview, Advantages, Disadvantages & How to InvestOctober 3, 2022Fixed Maturity Plans: Features, Pros, Cons & InvestingOctober 3, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle A sectoral mutual fund, as the name suggests, is an equity fund wherein the fund is invested in businesses belonging to the same industry. Such investments let investors expose their capital to a particular sector by investing in funds from the same industry. These kinds of funds are popular among mass investors and those who believe that a particular sector has immense growth potential in the near future. If you are unaware of what sector mutual funds are and how they function, we are here to help! This article discusses sector funds to help you decide whether they are right for you. How do sectoral funds work? The Indian market is divided into multiple sectors: pharmaceutical, manufacturing, banking, technology, etc. Besides, there are several niche sectors. Some of these sectors have been around for a long time. They have consistently delivered high returns, making them good investments. Sectoral funds are built with the intent to help investors capitalise on returns from such industries. The primary difference between regular equity and sectoral funds is that the capital is invested in multiple stocks across different industries in the former. On the other hand, in sectoral funds, the money is invested in multiple stocks from the same sector. A sector is a collection of businesses that belong to the same industry and more or less function similarly. Two companies from the same sector produce the same output or service. For instance, Wipro belongs to the tech industry, as does Infosys. Who should invest in sectoral funds? Sectoral funds work on the principle of high risk, high returns. These funds invest in a particular sector. While it is never wise to put all your eggs in the same basket, sometimes it might work to your advantage. You should invest in sectoral funds only if you can afford to take risks, as sectoral funds lack diversification. All your money is invested in a single sector, jeopardizing your entire capital. If the sector hits an unexpected low, all your money will go down the drain. In sectoral funds, your money is highly dependent on the performance of the sector you invest in. Owing to the risks involved, you must venture into sectoral funds only if you are a seasoned investor. If you have actively invested for several years, you will clearly understand the market. This aspect will help you determine which sector will most likely do well in the near future. Picking the right sector to invest in is crucial regarding sectoral funds, and seeking expert advice is highly recommended. Things to consider while investing in a sectoral fund. Investment goals: While investing in any fund, you must consider where you see the investment going in five years. Your investment horizon should be a minimum of five years to maximise returns, as any investment needs at least five years to reach its peak.Before you actually invest a large sum into a particular sector, consider your long-term investment goals. Investment risks: Typically, high risk accompanies high returns. Irrespective of the kind of fund you invest in, there is always a risk of loss. Since you are banking on a single sector to give you returns, sectoral funds are riskier.At no given point are the chances of the sector facing a backlash null, and there is always a chance that you might face heavy losses. Hence, be aware of the risks involved before investing in an industry. If the market crashes, be prepared to face losses. Exposure limit: Exposing your capital to different kinds of investment ensures stability and financial security. Therefore, experts always recommend a diverse Investing portfolio. Exposing a lot of money to the same kind of investment is not advisable.Since sectoral funds are high-risk, investors must not expose more than 5-10 % of their money. Expense ratio: The expense ratio is the fund you need to spend to maintain your investment. Investment banking companies charge a nominal fee for efficient fund management. It is like a fee paid to the fund managers for taking charge of your investments.It would help if you considered the expense ratio as well. If the fund management of a particular investment is pricey, then there‚Äôs no point in investing in the particular fund.

    "answer": "How to Pay Credit Card Bill from Another Credit CardAugust 23, 2024How to Save MoneyAugust 23, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle An Aadhaar card is a unique biometric-based document issued to every Indian citizen. While it doesn‚Äôt have a specific purpose, it establishes the identity of a person. You can quote your Aadhaar number to identify yourself, rather like a Social Security number in the United States. However, you cannot avail the facilities that your Aadhaar Card has to offer without linking your mobile number with it. This is because UIDAI sends you a one-time password (OTP) on your registered mobile number for authentication purposes. Here are the steps to update and link your mobile number to your Aadhaar card. When Should You Add Your Mobile Number to Your Aadhaar Card? You need to link your mobile number to your Aadhaar card if: Your mobile number was not recorded at the time of application. You have changed your mobile number. Previously, you could register your mobile number with Aadhaar through a Self-Service Update Portal (SSUP).

However, the staff may wish to verify your physical identity through biometrics. You will receive an acknowledgement slip with your Update Request Number (URN). Use this number to track the status of your application. You will receive an email (if you have updated your email address with UIDAI) and an SMS on your registered mobile number once it‚Äôs updated on the system. Receiving a text message on your mobile phone from UIDAI is sufficient proof that they have updated the information that you submitted. If you have submitted your email address, you will start receiving notifications as required (such as OTPs) through text messages on your mobile and email messages. For any queries to UIDAI, you can call their toll-free telephone number ‚Äì 1947.

    "question": "Section 80C of Income Tax Act ‚Äì Limits, Deductions, and Additional Deductions",
    "answer": "Lump Sum Investment Plan 2023: Meaning and OverviewSeptember 1, 2022Types of Equity Funds in India and its Benefits & ImportanceSeptember 1, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle The Income Tax Act, 1961 offers several benefits and deductions when you invest in certain financial products. Section 80C is a clause in the Act that lists the investments and expenses that are eligible for income tax deductions. For effective financial planning, you need to be completely aware of tax planning. Being aware of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act is imperative for the same. This article will go over the details of Section 80C Income Tax. What is Section 80C of the Income Tax Act? Section 80C allows you to deduct up to 1.5 lakh from your taxable income for certain investments. In instance, Section 80CCC allows a person to deduct up to 1.5 lakh per year for contributions paid to selected pension schemes. However, there are certain sub-section of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 called 80CCC, 80CCD(1), 80CCD(1B) and 80CCD(2). <Details of these sections are mentioned below>. Thus, the overall tax deduction available under section 80C is Rs 1.5 lakhs (under sections 80C, 80CCC, 80CCD(1) and 80CCD(2)) and an additional amount of Rs 0.5 lakhs under section 80CCD(1B). How does Section 80C work? If you are new to the list of tax benefits and Section 80 C, let us take a step-by-step look into how it works. Section 80 C is a set of deductions that you can avail of against your overall taxable income for the previous year. It enables individuals to minimize their taxable income by making tax-advantaged investments or incurring qualified expenses. It enables a maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh from the taxpayer‚Äôs total income per year. Assume you got total taxable earnings of Rs 20,00,000 in the previous year, 2023-24. The Assessment Financial Year will be 2024-25 when you calculate and pay the tax amount on this earning. The overall tax deduction available under section 80C is Rs 1.5 lakhs (under section 80C, 80CCC, 80CCD(1) and 80CCD(2)) and an additional amount of Rs 0.5 lakhs under section 80CCD(1B), thereby amounting to a total of Rs 2 lakhs. Suppose you have invested Rs. 2 lakhs of these earnings in any or all of the activities described in Sec 80C. In that case, you reduce your overall tax liability for the previous year to Rs 1.8 lakhs. Eligibility criteria for section 80C deductions The benefits are available to individuals and HUFs. Additionally, Indians, as well as Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), are eligible for tax deductions. You must file your income tax return (ITR) by July 31 every year to enjoy the Section 80C benefits. How can I get tax breaks from Section 80C of the Income Tax Act? Tax deductions make a huge difference when it comes to tax filing. Suppose you want to keep as much money as possible for yourself. In that case, you will want to know about every single itemized deduction available. The best way to do that is to talk to your accountant if you have one or to use an online tax calculator during tax season. Section 80C activities are grouped into two categories: Investments: You place your funds in assets for some time and then withdraw them. Provident Fund (VPF ‚Äì Voluntary Provident Fund or EPF ‚Äì Employee Provident Fund) National Saving Certificate 5-year Post Office Time Deposit NHB Deposit Scheme Public Provident Fund Tax-saving 5-year Fixed Deposit from Bank Senior Citizen Saving Scheme Life Insurance Premium Equity Linked Saving Scheme Unit Linked Insurance Plans Atal Pension Yojana (New Pension Scheme) Insurance Company Pension Plans Spending: You spend your cash on the activities indicated in section 80C. Principal Amount Repayment of Home Loan Stamp Duty & Home Registration Cost 2-children Tuition Fees To take full advantage of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, you need to be aware of the elements you can add to the list. At least one of these elements must apply to every taxpayer. If anyone adds more, they could likely reduce their tax liability considerably. This deduction is just an addition to your annual expenses. However, you should not miss it since the savings on that front can go a long way in helping you meet other financial goals. How much tax break can I get from Section 80C of the Income Tax Act?

    "question": "Understanding Price Elasticity of Demand ‚Äì Examples and Calculations",
    "answer": "Cost of Living in Chennai for Bachelors, Couples, and FamiliesAugust 8, 2024RBI‚Äôs E-mandate for Recurring TransactionsAugust 8, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Although consumer behavior is uncertain, the primary objective of the marketing and product teams in an organization is to increase usage, conversion, and positive brand outlook. Price optimization is important to ensure the company‚Äôs long-term stability. One of the important aspects of price optimization is determining its elasticity. This blog discusses how businesses can increase the demand by making their products more inelastic via marketing and product development. What Is Price Elasticity of Demand? Price elasticity of demand (PED) is an economic indicator of changes in consumer behavior when product pricing changes. Economists use this measure to explain the effects of price changes on demand and supply and the working of the real economies. Some products like fuel are inelastic. It means that even if the oil prices increase, the demand will not be significantly impacted as people still need fuel to travel for work and other purposes. When the demand for a product is significantly impacted by changes in its prices, it is known as ‚Äòelastic‚Äô. On the other hand, if the demand is only marginally impacted, the product is called ‚Äòinelastic‚Äô. Price Elasticity of Demand Formula Price Elasticity of Demand formula is: PED = % change in the quantity demanded / % change in price The equation can be further expanded to: PED = [(Q1 ‚Äì Q0) / (Q1 + Q0)]/ [(P1 ‚Äì P0) / (P1 + P0)] Q0 is the initial quantity Q1 is the final quantity P0 is the initial price P1 is the final price How to Calculate Price Elasticity of Demand? Generally, demand for a product reduces when the price increases, and therefore, most often the price elasticity coefficient is negative. However, it is important to note that a decrease in demand does not necessarily mean a reduction in revenues. The higher profit margin may compensate for the decrease in demand. Here is the step-by-step Price Elasticity of Demand calculation: Determine the initial price and quantity (P0 and Q0, respectively) and then decide the target quantity based on the final price (Q1 and P1, respectively). Calculate the numerator by dividing the quantity difference by the initial and final quantities [(Q1 ‚Äì Q0) / (Q1 + Q0)]. Calculate the denominator by dividing the quantity difference by the initial and final prices [(P1 ‚Äì P0) / (P1 + P0)]. PED is calculated by dividing the result of step 2 by the result of step 3. Price Elasticity of Demand Example Here are some price elasticity of demand examples. Assume that the petrol price was INR 50 per liter, which increased to INR 60 per liter. As a result, the demand for petrol at a fuel station reduced from 100 liters per day to 80 liters per day. The PED is calculated as below:Percentage change in quantity = (80 ‚Äì 100) / (80+100) = -11.11% Percentage change in price = (60 ‚Äì 50) / (60 + 50) = 9.09% PED = -11.11% / 9.09% = -1.22 A small bakery sells 180 loaves of bread every week for INR 20 per loaf. It increases the price to INR 25 per loaf, which results in sales dropping to 140 loaves per week. The PED in this example is:Percentage change in quantity = (140 ‚Äì 180) / (140+180) = -12.50% Percentage change in price = (25 ‚Äì 20) / (25 + 20) = 11.11% PED = -12.50%/11.11% = -1.13 What Are the 4 Factors That Determine Price Elasticity? Companies aim to make their products inelastic as much as possible, which means the demand is not significantly affected even if they increase the price. Here are 4 factors that affect PED: Nature of product Necessary products like water, electricity, gas, and the like are generally inelastic as these are consumed even if the prices increase. On the other hand, luxuries like entertainment, vacations, and much more are price-sensitive, and consumers may stop spending on these in case of difficult situations. Availability of substitutes If the company‚Äôs products have several competitors and are easily replaceable, a price increase can significantly reduce its demand because consumers will switch to a competitor‚Äôs product. The company needs to provide unique features that help to retain their customers even if the price increases. Actual cost of the products As a result of psychological pricing, the higher the price of a product, the more is the elasticity. For example, if the cost of a packet of pens increases, most customers won‚Äôt even notice it. However, if the pr",

    "question": "What Is Minimum Amount Due in Credit Card?",
    "answer": "Loan on Credit Card ‚Äì Application Process, Requirements, Comparison, And BenefitsAugust 16, 2024What is Credit Card Pin & How to Generate Credit Card PinAugust 16, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle It‚Äôs the beginning of the month, and you are all set to pay your monthly bills. While scrolling through them, you catch your credit card statement. The total outstanding amount is huge, and you cannot currently repay it, but then you catch the minimum due, and it seems to fit your financial budget for the month. But what is the minimum due? And is there any benefit of repaying only the minimum due on your credit card? What is Minimum Amount Due in Credit Card? The minimum payment on a credit card is the smallest amount a cardholder needs to pay by the due date to keep their account in good standing. This amount is usually a small percentage of the total outstanding balance, typically between 5% and 10%. Credit card issuers calculate this minimum payment using a specific formula that takes into account the current balance, recent purchases, and any applicable fees. How Does a Credit Card Minimum Due Work? The minimum amount due on your credit card is the smallest amount you can pay towards your monthly credit card balance. So, if you face a cash crunch for the month, you can pay the minimum balance due instead of paying the entire amount to avoid penalties or late payment charges. However, you should be aware that the remaining amount will incur interest rates even after paying the minimum amount. The minimum due on a credit card is the smallest payment amount, typically calculated as a percentage of the outstanding balance. Some banks may also set a fixed monthly payment towards your credit card balance. If your balance falls below the minimum payment requirement, you‚Äôll need to pay the full amount. It‚Äôs important to understand the minimum payment policy of your issuing bank before applying for an online credit card, as this policy can vary between banks. Calculating the Minimum Due on a Credit Card with Example To determine the minimum due on your credit card, simply refer to your monthly billing statement. The minimum due is calculated as a percentage of your outstanding balance. Both the total amount due and the specific minimum amount due for the billing cycle are highlighted on your statement. The percentage used to calculate this amount can vary based on your card issuer‚Äôs policies and the type of credit card you have. Example: if your outstanding balance is ‚Çπ20,000 and the minimum due is set at 5%, your required payment would be ‚Çπ1,000 (‚Çπ20,000 x 0.05). Benefits of Paying the Minimum Amount on Your Credit Card Paying the minimum balance on your credit card is important, especially if you don‚Äôt have the full amount to pay. There are several benefits of doing so, including: Avoid Late Payments If you don‚Äôt pay the minimum due on your credit card by the due date, your card issuer may charge late payment fees. These fees can vary depending on your outstanding balance and can add unnecessary financial strain, which can be avoided with timely payments. Depending on your balance, late fees could range from a few hundred to several thousand rupees. Maintain Your Credit Score Your credit score is a numerical indicator of your creditworthiness and influences your ability to secure credit in the future. Making timely minimum payments on your credit card helps maintain a positive credit history, while missed or late payments can harm your credit score. Whenever you miss a payment, your card issuer reports it to credit bureaus, negatively affecting your credit score. This can make it harder to obtain loans or credit lines in the future. Monitor Your Spending Patterns Paying the minimum amount due on your credit card helps monitor your spending pattern by ensuring you only cover essential expenses while leaving a balance. This approach forces you to track and manage your expenditures more closely, as the remaining balance accrues interest, making you more conscious of unnecessary spending. How Does Your Credit Card Billing Cycle Work? Understanding the minimum amount due on a credit card starts with knowing how the billing cycle works. Typically lasting around 30 days, this cycle runs from the date of the last statement to the closing date of the current one. During this time, all transactions made with the credit card are recorded, and a statement is produced at the end of the cycle. This statement outlines key details such as the t",

    "answer": "5 Best Credit Card for Utility Bill Payment in India 2025August 22, 2024How to Check Credit Card BalanceAugust 23, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Credit card rewards programs can turn your everyday spending into valuable benefits. Whether you‚Äôre aiming to collect points for travel, earn cashback, or enjoy other perks, knowing how to use these points wisely can make a big difference in your finances. In this article, we‚Äôll walk you through how to earn, maximise, and redeem your credit card reward points so you can get the most out of every swipe. What are Reward Points? Every cardholder can earn reward points on their credit cards with every transaction they make. You can later redeem these points through vouchers and gifts. The reward points are some types of benefits you earn through your bank when you make transactions on your credit card, but you cannot convert these points back into cash. Reward points can be anything, such as merchandise, vouchers, or even shopping benefits. But you should know how to use your reward points by redeeming them. How to Use Credit Card Reward Points? While reward points can come with benefits through redeemable vouchers and some gifts, you should know how to use them to take advantage of this facility. Here‚Äôs how to use your credit card reward points: Log into your bank account : Use the mobile app or visit your bank‚Äôs official website to log into your bank account. Locate to the credit card section: Locate the section dedicated to your credit cards. This is usually under a tab labelled ‚ÄúCredit Cards‚Äù or something similar on the main screen of the website or app. Select your card: Choose the specific credit card you want to redeem points for. Find the redemption option: Look for a menu item or button labelled ‚ÄúRedeem Credit Card Points‚Äù or something equivalent. It might be under ‚ÄúRewards,‚Äù ‚ÄúOffers,‚Äù or a similar section. Explore reward options: Discover the various ways you can redeem your points. Common options include: Merchandise: Redeem points for products from a catalogue Gift Cards: Exchange points for gift cards to your favourite stores Travel Rewards: Book flights, hotels, or vacations using your points Cashback: Convert points into cash or statement credits Balance Transfers: Use points to pay off other debts Charitable Donations: Donate your points to a chosen charity Check your point balance: Verify the total number of reward points available for redemption. Be aware of any minimum point requirements for specific rewards. Choose your reward: Select the reward that best suits your preferences and point balance. Consider the value of the reward compared to the number of points required. Confirm redemption: Review the redemption details carefully, including the number of points to be redeemed and any associated terms and conditions. Click on the ‚ÄúRedeem Points‚Äù or similar button to finalise the transaction. Receive confirmation: You will typically receive an email or SMS confirming your redemption. This confirmation will include details about how to claim your reward, such as a redemption code or instructions for delivery. How to Maximise the Benefits of Your Reward Points While there are already great benefits on your credit cards, you can still maximise these benefits on your credit card reward points. Here‚Äôs how: Understand the value of your reward points: They can vary significantly depending on how you choose to redeem them. For instance, using points for travel bookings often provides a higher return than opting for cash back or gift cards. It‚Äôs worth researching the point value associated with different redemption options offered by your credit card to ensure you‚Äôre getting the best deal. Keep track of the expiration date: Building up a substantial reward balance can certainly enhance your redemption value. However, it‚Äôs important to note that most credit card reward points typically expire within two years of being earned. To avoid losing any points, make sure to plan your redemptions carefully. Read the terms and conditions carefully: Each credit card has its unique structure for earning, redeeming, and expiring points, which is often detailed in the fine print. By understanding these specifics, cardholders can strategically use their cards to earn the maximum number of points possible, avoiding any missed opportunities or pitfalls like point expiration or redemption restrictions. Know the redemption rate: Just as the potential to earn rewards varies with each card, ",

    "question": "Difference between Credit Card and Debit Card",
    "answer": "What is a Credit Card Interest Rate?August 5, 202410 Best Travel Credit Cards in India 2025August 6, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Ôªø Debit and credit cards appear similar‚Äîthey are the same size, have the 16-digit card number, and your name and the card‚Äôs expiry date are mentioned on both. Moreover, you can use these cards to make cashless payments and withdraw money from an ATM. But are they really the same? Well, there is a lot of difference between credit card and debit card. This article covers everything you need to know about how these identical-looking cards differ. What Is Credit Card? A credit card is a type of unsecured personal loan which you can repay within 20 to 50 days. It is an interest-free loan if you pay it back on time. Failing to do so might also lead to a penalty fee along with the due interest. What Is Debit Card? Your bank issues the debit card against your savings or current account. When you use the card to withdraw money from ATM or swipe it to purchase something, the amount is immediately deducted from your account. So, your bank balance is the spending limit of the debit card. Credit Card Vs Debit Card Differences Are you wondering, ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between credit cards and debit cards?‚Äù The major factor that shows the difference is the credit limit. With the use of debit cards, you can make purchases using money that has been deposited in a bank. With credit cards, you can borrow money from the card issuer up to a predetermined limit in order to make purchases or cash withdrawals. Most likely, you carry a debit card and at least one credit card in your wallet. Using a debit card is like using cash in hand, as you can spend only what you have. But credit cards come with a credit limit that is not dependent on your bank balance. The credit limit is the amount of money you can spend using your card. It depends on the type of credit card you have, your bank, salary, and other aspects. In some cases, the credit limit can be three times your monthly income, which comes in handy in times of financial emergencies. Apart from the credit limit, there are other credit card and debit card differences, too. The below table explains the dissimilarities. Credit Card vs Debit Card Aspects Debit card Credit card Payment source You pay from your bank account. The credit card company pays at first. You must repay the amount as per your billing cycle. Statement The transactions are recorded in your bank statements, there are no separate statements for the card. The credit card company sends you a transaction statement every month. Fee PIN generation and annual maintenance fee. Joining fee, late payment fee, annual fee, and multiple other costs. Interest No interest is charged as the amount is deducted from your bank account. Interest is charged if you do not pay the bill within the due date. Fund limit Equals to your bank account balance. Equals to the card‚Äôs credit limit. Rewards Minimal rewards on spending. Cashback, reward points, air miles, and much more. Additional privileges Generally, not many privileges. Plenty of privileges like discounts on travel, dining, entertainment, retail, and more depending on your card type. Lost card protection Minimal liability protection 100% liability protection in case of a lost card, ensuring you do not pay for unauthorized expenses Advantages of Credit Card Convenience: Credit cards eliminate the need for carrying cash all the time. You can use the card for payment in most places. Future loans: If you plan to opt for any loan in the future but have a low credit score, the card will help you improve it. Rewards: Using a credit card enables you to receive many rewards in the form of points, cash back, and other facilities. Spending flexibility: Unlike debit cards, a credit card‚Äôs spending limit does not depend on your bank balance. This flexibility is helpful when you need to make significant purchases and do not have enough money in your account. Disadvantages of Credit Card Transaction charge: When you use the card in a shop or restaurant, the credit card company charges the establishment a transaction fee. The business includes this charge in your bill; so, eventually, you end up paying it. Maintenance charge and other fees: Some credit card companies charge you a flat annual maintenance fee. They also charge a minimum spending fee if you do not spend a fixed minimum amount in a year. Additionally, you need to pay a 3.5% cash advance fee when using the card t",

    "question": "How to Check Credit Card Balance",
    "answer": "How to Use Credit Card Reward PointsAugust 22, 2024How to Pay Credit Card Bill from Another Credit CardAugust 23, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Regularly checking your credit card balance is necessary to avoid overspending on your credit card and disrupting your finances. It also helps you avoid any late payment fees and helps you maintain a good credit score. But what is a credit card balance, and how can you check it? What is a Credit Card Balance? Your credit card balance, also known as the statement balance, represents the remaining funds after subtracting your spending from your credit limit. As you make purchases, your available balance decreases, increasing when you pay off your credit card bills. You can easily check your balance by inquiring with your credit card provider. Keeping track of this balance is crucial, especially if you frequently use your card. It‚Äôs easy to overspend on big-ticket items, leading to debt if not managed properly. Regularly monitoring your available credit helps you pay off your dues on time. The credit card balance includes the unbilled and outstanding amounts you owe to your bank or credit card issuer. If you miss a payment, you‚Äôll be charged finance fees on the overdue amount, so timely payments are essential. How to Check Credit Card Balance Checking your credit card balance is extremely important to keep track of your expenses. Here are different ways in which you can check your credit card balance: Internet Banking Through internet banking, you can check your credit card balance online. To access your credit card details online, you‚Äôll need to register it with your net banking account. If you‚Äôre an existing customer, your credit card will automatically link to your account. Otherwise, you‚Äôll have to link it manually. After registering, you can navigate to the credit card section in the menu. Here, you‚Äôll find options such as credit card balance, available balance, balance statement, and bill payment. These features allow you to track how much credit you‚Äôve used, check your remaining credit limit, view the bill‚Äôs due date, and easily make payments. This tool helps cardholders manage their spending and ensures timely bill payments. Mobile Application An easy way to check your credit card balance is through your bank‚Äôs mobile app. If you have internet banking activated, you can log in from any mobile device and view your balance with just a tap. The mobile app also offers other features, such as transferring money, requesting changes to your account information, and updating your personal details. Mobile SMS If you‚Äôve signed up for SMS transaction alerts, your bank will notify you of your credit card balance on your registered mobile number each time you make a purchase. Be sure to monitor these messages to stay informed about your outstanding balance. Bank Branch You can also visit your bank‚Äôs nearest branch for a credit card balance inquiry. By providing some card-related information, bank representatives can give you all the details about your available balance. However, this method is time-consuming and less common in today‚Äôs technology-driven world. Customer Service You can reach out to your bank‚Äôs customer support to inquire about your credit card‚Äôs minimum balance. The support executive will request an authentication PIN to verify your identity. For your convenience, customer support is available 24/7. ATM Another way to check your available credit card balance is to visit an ATM. Simply insert your card and follow the on-screen instructions. You‚Äôll then be prompted to enter your PIN for authentication. Monthly Credit Card Statement Each month, banks and credit card issuers send out credit card statements to their customers. These statements, generated at the end of each billing cycle, are delivered via email or to your residential address if you‚Äôve opted for a hard copy. Typically, these statements are password-protected, ensuring that only the cardholder can access them. The password is usually a combination of the cardholder‚Äôs card number, date of birth, or similar details. Why is it Important to Check Your Credit Card Balance? Now that you know how to check your credit card balance, you need to understand why it is important to check this balance regularly. Here are some reasons why: A Understand the outstanding balance Regularly checking your balance allows you to track your outstanding amount, ensuring timely payments.

    "question": "COVID-19 Insurance | Too much fine-print, too little cover?",
    "answer": "Laying the foundations of a new financial systemDecember 14, 2020 Table of Contents Toggle This handy blog was written by Jigar Vachharajani, Head of Finance at SalesKen and a Jupiter Community member! If you‚Äôd like to contribute to the Jupiter Blog, write to us at community@jupiter.money. In less than 4 months, COVID-19 has completely shaken up the world. Economies across the globe, whether large or small, are in the same boat, fighting this pandemic ‚Äì and India is no different. The fear of COVID-19 is mounting by the day and people are more cautious than ever before. Wary of this situation and pandemic, several health insurance companies have come out with health covers exclusively for the Coronavirus disease. COVID-19 coverage on a single click and at very low premiums (in the range of INR 150 to 1,000) is the motto of most of these insurers. Considering the panic on account of COVID-19, it becomes very important for everyone to not jump the gun in haste, but instead make a well-informed decision about purchasing COVID-exclusive insurance covers. Policy in a single click, without a single test? Yes, you heard it right, but it is important to understand how insurers cover their risk of issuing policies to COVID-19-positive cases. If you look closely, all the policies available today have an initial waiting period of 14-16 days, i.e., the policy will become effective only after completion of the said period. If a person is diagnosed COVID-positive within the waiting period, the cover is not applicable. Furthermore, most of these policies have ‚Äòinternational travel restriction clauses,‚Äô which deny benefits to anyone with a history of international travel over the last 45-60 days. Some of the policies also have a cohabitation clause, which states that if a person is cohabiting with someone already diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, they will not be eligible for the cover. One more noteworthy fact is that most insurers are covering only up to the age group of 65 years. This is based on an underlying assumption that senior citizens are more vulnerable to the virus. All these entry-level restrictions help insurers reduce the risk quotient substantially, while issuing the policy to individuals at large. Various coverages on offer Broadly, there are two types of covers which are available in the market: Fixed benefit cover: Basically a lump sum cover assuring a fixed sum benefit to the COVID-19 positive cases. These policies cover between INR 20,000 and 50,000. Indemnity cover: Provides hospitalization expenses (both pre and post) at actuals on diagnosis of COVID-19. A key point to look out for in a fixed benefit cover is whether in-patient hospitalization is mandatory for claiming the benefit or not. Majority of fixed benefit covers honor the claim only if the patient is hospitalized and mere diagnosis will not make them eligible for the benefit. Home quarantine or self-isolation is not considered as being quarantined and so cannot be considered for the claim benefit. Further, in almost all the covers, claims are eligible only if the insured person is identified and tested COVID-19-positive by a Government-accredited hospital or testing centre. Any test from unauthorized centres will not be considered for the purposes of the claim. Some of the factors which can be considered in deciding the cover and the option: Age of a person: Anyone within the age group of 25-40 (with lesser risk of symptomatic COVID case), can opt for the fixed benefit option, while others can consider indemnity option. Also, anyone above the age of 45 should opt for a higher coverage, since hospitalization and treatment costs for respiratory illness would be substantially higher. City of residence: A metro resident (opting for an indemnity plan) needs to opt for higher coverage than a non-metro resident. Anything above INR 1 Lakh of cover would be good for a metro resident. Coverage in the existing policy: Anyone who already holds a mediclaim cover may not opt for either option as COVID-19 is covered in most mediclaim policies.

    "answer": "5 Best Credit Card for Insurance Payments ‚Äì Top Options & BenefitsOctober 9, 202419 Types of Personal Loans in IndiaOctober 9, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle It‚Äôs the beginning of the month and you‚Äôve already spent your salary but you really need to buy new furniture for your house. Or you‚Äôve a few leaves on your hand but the holiday you‚Äôve been planning needs more funds than you‚Äôve at your dispense at the moment. Feeling relatable? Understandable. At this point, two popular options might come to your mind: credit card loans and personal loans. Both offer a quick ticket towards financial salvation. But the decision between the two depends on a number of factors, mainly the amount and the urgency with which the money is required. The following article will explain to you the differences between them to help you make a decision you don‚Äôt regret later on. Credit Card Loan vs Personal Loan: A Comparison Here‚Äôs a side-by-side comparison of the features of both, credit card loans and personal loans to help you understand which option might be the best for you. Criteria Credit Card Loan Personal Loan Type of Loan Pre-approved, often as an extension of your existing credit limit Unsecured loan offered based on income and credit score Documentation Minimal documentation required. Primarily based on your credit card history Proof of identity, address and income required Disbursal Time Immediate or within a few hours 3-5 Business days Eligibility Available to existing credit cardholders with good credit standing Open to salaried and self-employed individuals with a strong credit profile Loan Amount Limited to the credit limit Calculated by the bank based on income verification Interest Higher interest, impacting your EMI Lower interest rates, with potential reductions via balance transfers Charges No processing fee in most cases Processing fees, prepayment charges, and other administrative fees Procedure for Borrowing By accepting a pre-approved offer from the bank or submitting an application By applying to a bank or financial institution with documentation Tenure Shorter tenure, usually up to 5 years. Flexible tenures, usually ranging from 1-7 years Credit Card 01 What is Credit Card Loan? A credit card loan is a pre-approved loan you can get based on how you‚Äôve used and repaid your credit card. It‚Äôs quick, doesn‚Äôt need paperwork, and the loan amount is usually a part of your credit card limit that hasn‚Äôt been used. But unlike a cash withdrawal, this loan is offered directly through the card, and you‚Äôll also be charged interest if it‚Äôs not repaid on time. So, while it‚Äôs convenient, it can get a little expensive if you delay payments and have to pay the high interest rates. 02 When to Opt for a Credit Card Loan? Going for a credit card loan is practical when you need ready cash but do not have the time for very lengthy approval periods. It is ideal when the amount is not too large, and also when you fail the qualification test for a personal loan. In some cases, the rates of credit card loans are even much more gratifying than personal loans. So, it becomes a smart choice for meeting short-term financial needs. 03 How to Apply for a Credit Card Loan? The process of applying for a credit card loan is relatively easy. Most credit card issuers today allow you to apply directly from their website or from their mobile app. Alternatively, you can call their customer service to help you with the application if you want. Once approved, the loan amount is either credited to your bank account or made available for spending on your card, so you can access the funds right away.

A personal loan gives you a set amount of money to use for various purposes, like home repairs or medical bills, which you have to pay back in installments. Unlike specific loans for cars or homes, personal loans are very flexible but may have some restrictions. It‚Äôs different from a credit line, where you borrow as needed, like with a credit card. 02 When to Opt for a Personal Loan? If you require a larger loan, a personal loan will be the better option. Even though the procedure can take a longer period of time, the waiting is worth it when you require more funds. Personal loans also offer the flexibility to shop around, so compare different offers, and choose the best one for your needs. Additi",

    "question": "Difference Between Shares And Debentures",
    "answer": "ULIP vs Mutual Funds: Which is a better investment?September 25, 2023Difference Between REIT and InvIT? Meaning and Types in DetailOctober 5, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Every business requires capital to operate and expand. It can source its capital from the company‚Äôs promoters or shareholders or through debt. When a company raises money from its owners, they are offered a right to participate in the company‚Äôs profits by way of equity shares. On the other hand, when the company borrows money by issuing securities such as debentures or bonds, it is raising money through debt. Although both are different forms of raising capital, they are very different from each other. In this article, we will highlight the difference between equity shares and debentures in detail. What are equity shares? Equity shares, also known as stock, represent ownership of a company. When a company raises money from the market, it is diluting its ownership. It will issue equity shares to the proportion of the money it receives. The person who holds these shares are known as equity shareholders. Equity shareholders are entitled to receive a share in the company‚Äôs profits to the extent of shares held by them in the form of dividends. They can also participate in the company‚Äôs critical decisions, such as the appointment of a director or merger or acquisitions, through voting rights. A company issues equity shares primarily to expand and run the business. It either issues shares privately or through a public offering, which is popularly known as an IPO or initial public offering. When a company issues shares for the first time to the public, it does so through an IPO. You can become a shareholder of a company by subscribing to the IPO or purchasing the shares from the stock exchange. When shares are listed on the stock exchange, the price of the share fluctuates based on market demand and supply. If the demand is more, it implies people are buying more, so the price of the share rises. In contrast, if the supply is more, then people are selling the share more, so the price of the equity share falls. Hence, when you buy shares of a company, you are benefitting from the dividend and the capital appreciation. Types of equity shares Following are the different types of equity shares in the market. Ordinary shares: Shares that the company first issues through an IPO are known as ordinary shares. Bonus shares: When a company issues additional shares to the shareholders from its retained earnings, it is called a bonus issue, and the shares that are issued are known as bonus shares. Rights shares: Shares that are only issued to premium shareholders at a discounted rate to raise additional capital to run the company are known as rights shares. Sweat equity: When the directors or key employees receive shares at a discount in exchange for their extraordinary performance or contribution to the company, then the shares are known as sweat equity. Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP): Companies issue shares to employees as a retention strategy and also as a form of compensation for the work done by them. Employees who exercise their ESOP will own the shares of the company. What are debentures? Debentures are securities a company issues to borrow funds from the market. They are long-term debt instruments that are issued under the seal of a company. The debenture holders are creditors to the company and are entitled to interest. When the debenture expires, the company must pay back the principal amount (borrowed funds) along with the interest to the debenture holders. Debentures are unsecured loans, so the company doesn‚Äôt provide any collateral when they issue debentures. Companies usually prefer the debenture route when they have already pledged all their assets and shares and need more money to raise capital. Debenture holders do not carry any voting rights and, hence, do not have a say in the company‚Äôs operations. Moreover, they are not eligible to participate in the company‚Äôs profits and hence don‚Äôt receive dividends. However, they receive an interest which is paid on a regular basis or directly at the time of maturity of the debenture. If the company goes for liquidation, debenture holders have the first preference over the company‚Äôs assets and funds. Credit rating agencies rate debentures of public companies, and hence, before buying a debenture from the stock exchange, you can check the creditworthiness of the company. A debenture with a high rating implies ",

    "question": "ULIP vs Mutual Funds: Which is a better investment?",
    "answer": "Best Time to Buy & Sell Mutual Funds in IndiaSeptember 8, 2023Difference Between Shares And DebenturesSeptember 25, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle The investing world has a plethora of investments available in the market. Of all the investments, the two most popular ones among retail investors are mutual funds and Unit Linked Investment Plans (ULIPs). Although very different, these two compete for a significant portion of your wallet. So, let‚Äôs compare ULIP vs. mutual funds and understand the advantages and limitations of each. What is a ULIP? ULIP is Unit Linked Investment Plan ‚Äì a financial instrument that combines life insurance with investments. The scheme allows you to avail insurance benefits while helping you accumulate wealth for your long-term goals. When you pay a premium, it is divided into two parts: one goes towards the insurance premium, and the other goes towards various financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and government securities. Features of ULIP Life cover: ULIP allows you to secure the financial future of your family by providing term insurance. You can select the sum insured based on your need. Investment: Apart from providing you insurance, the scheme allows you to invest in financial securities, much like mutual funds. You can select the type of plan you invest in, and you have the flexibility to switch between funds to match your changing needs. Premium paying options: ULIPs have multiple premium paying options, such as single, monthly, half-yearly, or yearly. You can choose the one that will match your resources and goals the best. Top-ups: As your income increases, you can increase your premium payments as well through the top-up option. This top-up will be an additional investment over the existing investment. Partial withdrawal: If you need money to fund an emergency, you can partially withdraw from your ULIP plan after five years. However, there is a limit on the number of withdrawals and the amount you can withdraw. Advantages of ULIP Dual benefits: ULIPs provide the dual benefits of an insurance policy and an investment. With just one financial instrument, you can fulfil both your insurance and investment needs. Tax exemption: The premium you pay for your ULIP plan qualifies for tax deduction under Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The maturity benefit is also tax-free under Section 10 (10 D). Fund switching: In ULIPs, you can not only choose the type of funds you want to invest in, but you can also switch between funds without any additional charges or costs. This feature of ULIPs will help you switch when your goals are nearing or the market is very volatile. In such cases, you can switch from equity to debt and then again back to equity. Limitations of ULIP Expense ratio: ULIPs have a lot of expenses associated with them. They charge administration charges, fund management charges, switch charges, surrender charges, mortality charges, premium allocation and withdrawal charges from you. They deduct all these charges before investing in a fund of your choice. Hence, your total investment comes down by a substantial amount. Lock-in period: ULIPs have a lock-in period of five years. Hence, you cannot withdraw your money before this tenure. Even if you surrender your policy before five years, you will have to wait until five years to get back your money. Market volatility: ULIPs invest in marketable securities and hence are exposed to market volatility. In the initial years, the return from them is low or even negative. However, in the long term, they give decent returns. Complex instrument: ULIPs are a complex instrument as they are both an insurance and investment product. It can get difficult to keep track of the premium and NAVs (net asset value) of the fund, along with switching, redirecting, and investing decisions to maximise your gains. What is a mutual fund? Mutual funds are the most popular financial instruments. They pool money from several investors who have a similar objective and invest in marketable securities such as shares, bonds, debentures, and government securities. There are various types of mutual funds based on market capitalisation, asset type, duration, and risk factors. Hence, investors have a wide variety to choose from. Mutual funds are managed by professional fund managers who decide the asset allocation and the securities for the fund after doing thorough research. They strive to make profits for the investors, which is automatically reflected",

    "question": "What is CVV on Debit Card and Where to Find It?",
    "answer": "How To Use Credit Cards For Maximum Benefits?January 20, 2024How to Check Debit Card EMI Eligibility?January 25, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle CVV or Card Verification Value is a three-digit or four-digit number printed on the back of your debit card, which helps complete online transactions. It is issued by the banks and remains static until the debit card expires. You must keep your CVV number confidential to ensure your money is safe. Read on to learn more about CVV numbers, their importance, and how to protect them from fraud. What is CVV in a Debit Card? The CVV number is a protective and security layer that guards the card information when swiped at the point of sale (POS) machine or during online transactions. It is an external verification feature that banks use to ensure that the rightful cardholder has possession of the card. CVV number generated by the banks remains the same until the card expires or is damaged. CVV is not a random number; it is generated using a complex algorithm. The CVV is unique to every card and is based on the card number, expiration rate and other particular codes of the card issuer. Hence, every time you get a new card, you get a new CVV unique to that card. Merchants are not allowed to save the CVV number as it is against the Per Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCIDSS). If someone has the CVV of your card, then it can be misused, and you can lose your savings. Hence, it is important to keep your CVV and other card information, such as card number and expiry date, confidential. The primary purpose of the CVV number is to add an additional layer of security and ensure that only the cardholder is using the card. When you purchase products online, entering a CVV number is important. If not, you will not be able to complete the transaction. Even if someone gets hold of the card information, such as the card number and expiration date, they won‚Äôt be able to process the transaction without the CVV number. Different Names of CVV Card Verification Value is a standard industry term, but different issuers use a different name for it. The following are the different names of CVV. Acronym Full Form Card Issuer CVV2 Card Verification Value 2 Visa CVC2 Card Verification Code 2 Mastercard CID Card Identification Number American Express CVV Card Verification Value Discover How Does CVV Work? When you want to purchase something online and you proceed to check out, you must enter the CVV number in the payment gateway. Without the CVV, you cannot complete the transaction. By entering the CVV, you will confirm that the card is in your possession. It is just an extra layer of safety that banks use to reduce fraud. If you enter the wrong CVV, the transaction will not be processed. Despite being an added layer of security, CVV doesn‚Äôt protect cards from cybercrimes. Hence, it is best to avoid websites that do not ask CVV or do not have multiple layers of verification to complete a transaction. How to Find CVV in Debit Card? CVV is a three or four-digit code printed on the backside of your debit card or credit card. You can find it right below the magnetic strip. Usually, the first few digits of the CVV are hidden by the magnetic strip, and only the last few digits are visible. These last three or four digits are necessary to complete online transactions. Different Components of CVV The CVV comprises two components, namely the magnetic strip, which has the CVV 1, and the three-digit code visible to you on the card. CVV1: The magnetic strip on the card has an encrypted code which is not visible to the users. When the card is inserted into POS machines, the code is automatically read by the machines. The code is generated from a unique combination of your card number, expiry date, and the issuer‚Äôs unique code. CVV 2: The CVV 2 or CVV is the number visible to your eyes. It is a three-digit number that must be entered to complete the transaction. It is printed on the back of the card and cannot be read by the POS machines. You must enter it each time you shop online, no matter how frequently you shop on the website. How Does CVV Protect You From Frauds? CVVs are designed to prevent fraud during online transactions. When a merchant requests for CVV, it ensures that the card is in your possession. When an online hacker gets hold of your card information with the CVV, they will not be able to proceed forward and complete the transaction. Moreover, merchants are not allowed to save the CVV informat",

    "question": "Personal Loans vs Credit Cards: Which is Better?",
    "answer": "What Is Over Limit in Credit Card?September 3, 2024How to Check Credit Card StatementSeptember 3, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Personal loans and credit cards are two types of financial instruments that can help you with your expenses, but they each have different uses and features. Knowing the main differences between them is important to choose the one that fits your needs best. Personal loans give you a set amount of money all at once, which can be useful for handling large expenses or combining existing debts. They usually come with fixed monthly payments and a set interest rate, making it easier to plan and manage your budget. This can be especially helpful if you want a clear and structured way to pay off debt or make significant purchases. Credit cards offer a flexible line of credit that lets you make purchases and pay them off over time. They come with various perks like rewards points or cashback, which can benefit your daily spending. However, if you don‚Äôt pay off your balance in full, interest charges can add up quickly. Choosing between a personal loan and a credit card depends on your financial situation and what you need the money for. This blog will help you compare these options, showing their main features and benefits, so you can make a decision that suits your financial goals. What is a Credit Card? A Credit Card is a small card, often made of metal or plastic, that you use to make purchases. Instead of paying with cash or a debit card right away, you can charge the amount to your credit card and then pay off the balance later by a set due date. It works on a revolving credit system, which means you can use it repeatedly‚Äîspending up to a certain limit, paying off what you owe, and then using it again. Just make sure to stay within your credit limit and make payments on time to avoid extra fees and interest. When to opt for Credit Cards Credit cards can be a good option for: Everyday Purchases You can use a credit card when you want to buy something and you‚Äôre within your credit limit. It can be especially helpful for managing expenses through easy EMIs (Equated Monthly Instalments), which can make it easier to handle the cost of smaller, everyday items or purchases. Cashback and Reward Points Credit cards often offer rewards or cashback for purchases and bill payments. By using your card, you can earn points or get a percentage of your spending back, making it a good option for getting extra benefits from your regular spending. What is a Personal Loan? A personal loan is a type of loan that you can use for any purpose. It‚Äôs considered an unsecured loan, meaning you don‚Äôt need to provide any collateral to get it. The lender deposits the money directly into your account, and you repay it in instalments over a set period, along with interest. Unlike credit cards, personal loans have a fixed interest rate and a specific repayment schedule. This means you know exactly how much you‚Äôll owe and when you‚Äôll be done paying it back. When to opt for a Personal Loan Personal loans are often a good choice for larger expenses. Here are some situations where they can be helpful: Unexpected Costs: If you find yourself facing medical bills that aren‚Äôt covered by insurance, a personal loan can be a lifesaver. Even though the interest rates might be higher, it‚Äôs a convenient way to handle unexpected expenses. Debt Cleanup: If you have multiple loans to juggle, a personal loan can help you simplify things. By combining all your debts into one loan, you can make managing your finances easier and potentially save money. Celebrating Life‚Äôs Big Moments: Planning a wedding or hosting a big cultural event can be expensive. A personal loan can provide the financial flexibility you need to make those special occasions unforgettable. Credit Card Loan vs Personal Loan Aspect Personal Loans Credit Cards Nature of Debt You receive a lump sum amount upfront, to be repaid over time. Provides a revolving credit line, which you can use as needed up to a set limit. Interest Rates Interest rates are usually fixed and tend to be lower. Interest rates are often variable and generally higher. Repayment Structure You pay back the loan in fixed monthly instalments. You must make at least a minimum payment each month; the balance can carry over. Term Length Has a fixed repayment term, typically ranging from 1 to 7 years. No set term; you can continue using the card as long as your account is in good standing. Purpose of Use Usually taken fo",

    "answer": "Personal Loan Prepayment ‚Äì Part Prepayment, Charges, Features, and BenefitsAugust 23, 2024Secured Loans and Unsecured Loans: Meaning, Types, and DifferenceAugust 23, 2024 what-is-payroll Table of Contents Toggle Running a business in India is a complex undertaking, and one of the most important aspects of any successful operation is payroll management. Payroll involves the process of paying employees for their work, as well as managing employee benefits, deductions, and records. But what exactly is payroll and how can you ensure that your payroll system runs smoothly? This article provides an overview of the basics of payroll in India and offers a comprehensive guide to managing payroll effectively. What is Payroll? Payroll is a term that refers to the process of managing and calculating employees‚Äô salaries, wages, and other related benefits. It can be a complex task that requires careful attention to detail and accuracy. In today‚Äôs modern workplace, most businesses use software or outsourcing companies to handle their payroll needs. There are various components that make up payroll processing. Firstly, it involves tracking employee hours worked and calculating the appropriate pay rates based on things like overtime and shift differentials. Additionally, deductions must be made for taxes, insurance premiums, retirement contributions, and any other relevant expenses. Payroll also includes compliance with laws regarding minimum wage requirements, overtime rules, tax withholding procedures, and more. Companies must stay up-to-date with these regulations to avoid penalties or legal issues down the line. How Payroll is Calculated in India? To determine an employee‚Äôs pay in India, you can use the following equation: Net Pay = Gross Salary ‚Äì Gross Deduction Gross Salary refers to the total income earned by the employee, which includes their basic salary, house rent allowance (HRA), dearness allowance (DA), various allowances, and any one-time payments or incentives like reimbursements, arrears, bonuses, etc. On the other hand, Gross Deduction is the sum of different deductions, such as professional tax, employees‚Äô state insurance (ESI), public provident fund (PPF), income tax, insurance, leave adjustments, and any one-time deductions like loan recovery. By subtracting the total deductions from the gross salary, you can calculate the employee‚Äôs salary, which is the actual amount they will receive. Set up your payroll in 5 minutes With sumHR, you will get automatic payroll calculations, accurate tax compliances & always on time results. sumHR is a cloud-based free payroll software that will reduce payroll chaos and delivers timely salary payments, for all sizes of business. Check features of sumHR What Are the Different Stages in the Payroll Process? Determining the payroll of employees can prove to be a daunting task for any organization, given the numerous steps and components involved. Generally, the payroll process can be categorized into three stages, namely Pre-payroll, Actual payroll calculation, and Post-payroll. Let‚Äôs delve into each stage to gain a better understanding. Stage 1 ‚Äì Pre-Payroll Process During the initial stage, you would typically set up policies, define various components, and collect payroll inputs from all relevant sources. This phase can be further broken down into the following steps. 1. Defining Policy At the heart of any payroll process lies the need to establish clear policies pertaining to attendance, leave, benefits, and payroll. These policies encompass all the factors that contribute to an employee‚Äôs salary. To ensure consistency in the payroll process, it is essential to have these policies pre-approved by the management. Since policy changes occur infrequently, there is no need to perform this step repeatedly in every cycle. Fortunately, with the advent of online payroll software, it is now possible to configure a wide range of policies and salary structures for employees in line with the specific requirements of the organization. This can significantly streamline the payroll process and increase efficiency. 2. Collecting Data Input After defining the policies, the next step in the payroll process is to gather all the necessary data from various departments and managers to calculate the employee‚Äôs salary. This data includes attendance records, leave details, performance evaluations, salary revisions, loan recoveries, transportation expenses, and income tax information. For larger organiza",

    "question": "Best Time to Buy & Sell Mutual Funds in India",
    "answer": "A Complete Guide on Real Estate Mutual Funds: ‚Äì Jupiter MoneySeptember 4, 2023ULIP vs Mutual Funds: Which is a better investment?September 25, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle Mutual funds are one of the most popular investment avenues that appeal to a wide range of investors. When compared to different investments such as shares, real estate, and alternative investments, mutual funds are stable, affordable, and give reasonably secure returns. Despite being a popular investment choice, many don‚Äôt know when to invest in and redeem their mutual funds. In this article, we will cover the best time to buy and sell mutual funds in India. When is the best day to invest in mutual funds? When investing in mutual funds, the time you stay invested in the market is much more important than timing the market. The sooner you start investing, the higher the returns and the greater will be the wealth you can accumulate. This means the longer you stay invested in the market, the higher your returns will be. Let‚Äôs understand this with an example if you and your sister decide to invest Rs 10,000 a month in a mutual fund until you turn 60. Your current age is 30, and your sister‚Äôs is 35. So, each of you‚Äôll turn 60, you would‚Äôve invested for 30 years, and your sister would‚Äôve invested for 25 years. If the expected return is 12%, let‚Äôs see how much each of you would‚Äôve made by the time you turn 60. Particulars You Your Sister Monthly investment Rs 10,000 Rs 10,000 Current age 30 years 35 years Investment horizon 30 years 25 years Expected return 12% 12% Total investment Rs 36,00,000 Rs 30,00,000 Investment proceeds at the age of 60 Rs 3.52 crores Rs 1.89 crores The above example shows that the longer the investment horizon, the better the returns. By investing just Rs 6 lakhs more, for a duration of 5 more years at 12% estimated returns, you have the potential to make 1.8 times the returns than your sister. Just imagine what the returns would be if you started investing from the time you were 25 years! Hence, with mutual funds, the earlier you start investing, the higher the wealth you can accumulate. Is timing the market important to invest in mutual funds? When it comes to equities, timing the market is important. This is because if you invest at the start of the bull market, you can get higher returns than when you invest in the middle or at the peak of a bull market. Since equity mutual funds predominantly invest in the equity market, having good entry and exit points is necessary. This is because, as the market hits higher highs, the NAV (net asset value) of the mutual fund will also grow, resulting in higher returns for the investors. However, not all investors have the time and knowledge to time their entry and exit into mutual funds. Hence, it is best to follow certain practices so timing the market can be avoided altogether. Below are some of them. Take the SIP route Mutual funds allow investors to invest in regular instalments through the SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) route. With SIP, you can invest a fixed amount at regular intervals such as monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, or annually in mutual funds. You can also pause, cancel, and increase the instalment amount whenever you want. The best part about investing in mutual funds through the SIP route is the low investment. You can start investing in mutual funds with an amount as low as Rs 500 through SIP. Rupee Cost Averaging SIPs best work for long-term investment horizons. This means that over a longer period of time, SIPs can help increase returns by reducing the average cost of investment. Popularly known as rupee cost averaging, it means that by investing regularly in mutual funds across different market cycles, the investor‚Äôs average cost of investing comes down, which will increase the long-term returns. So, this basically means that if you invest in mutual funds in an upmarket, the cost per unit increases as the bulls have taken charge of the market. So, for the same amount of investment, you will get lesser units as the per-unit cost has increased. However, in a market downturn, if you continue you invest, you will get a higher number of units with the same amount of investment. This is because the per-unit cost will come down as the bears have taken charge. Let‚Äôs understand this with an example. If you first invested Rs 5,000 in a mutual fund with a NAV is Rs 10, you will get 500 units. However, as the per unit price increases to Rs 20, you will get 250 units, and if ",

    "question": "What Is Savings Account: Types & Benefits Of Savings Account",
    "answer": "How To Open A Bank Account In India: Online & Offline ProcessMarch 25, 2025What is Salary Slip- Components of Salary Slip, Format & Payslip BreakdownMarch 26, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle Savings Account is the most frequently used account in India. The savings account definition says that it is a bank account that promotes saving your funds. If you are an individual planning to keep your future secure, a savings account is the perfect go-to. The Savings Account provides you with interest on all your funds. Its other features, like limited withdrawals, regular deposits and provision of interest, make it the best alternative for a large population in India. Different types of savings account The savings bank account meaning has a vast explanation. Let us begin with the different types of savings accounts. Regular Savings Account Salary-based Savings Account Zero-balance Savings Account Women‚Äôs Savings Account Minor‚Äôs Savings Account Senior Citizen‚Äôs Savings Account Here is a detailed note on savings account meaning and different types of savings accounts to help you get well-versed with them. Regular Savings Account A regular savings account is like a locker where you can save all your funds. It does not ask for frequent deposits and works on its basic terms and conditions. It assures the safety and security of your money. Salary-based Savings Account The salary-based savings account acts as a payment disbursement platform for companies. The banks open it at the company‚Äôs request. When salary distribution arrives, the bank withdraws the payment from the company‚Äôs account and transfers it to the employees. Salary-based accounts do not require a minimum balance. Also, if a salary is not credited continuously for three months, the account is converted to a regular account. Zero-balance Savings Account A zero-balance savings account has combined current and savings account features. There are limits on the withdrawal amount. However, it does not charge a penalty if your account falls below the minimum balance required. Women‚Äôs Savings Account What is a savings account for women? Women‚Äôs savings account caters to banking and investment facilities for women. It comes with unique features and benefits for her. These include lower loan interest rates, waving off DEMAT account charges and special discounts. Minor‚Äôs Savings Account The main motive for curating a minor‚Äôs savings account is to educate the children about banking. If the minor is under 10, the account is operated by a guardian. After ten years of age, the child can manage the account. When the child turns 18, the account is converted to a regular savings account. Senior Citizen‚Äôs Savings Account The Senior citizen‚Äôs savings account is similar to the regular savings account. Yet, it offers many benefits and privileges to senior citizens. They get a higher rate of interest. The bank links the account to other old citizen savings schemes. It helps them get funds from their pension and retirement accounts in a single place. How do saving accounts work? A savings account works in a very systemized and organized way. FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) insures the deposits you make in the savings account. It provides only up to Rs 5,00,000 per depositor, insured bank, and ownership category. The savings account then offers you interest on your savings. The compound interest is deposited in your bank account, and you earn a new balance. How Savings Account Interest Rates Work Savings account interest is the return a bank pays you for keeping your money with them. The idea is simple: the bank uses your deposited funds to lend or invest, and in return, it shares a small portion of its earnings with you as interest. Factors That Affect Savings Account Interest Rates 1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Policy Rates The repo rate and reverse repo rate set by the RBI influence how much banks can earn when they lend money. When RBI raises rates ‚ûù Banks may offer higher savings interest to attract deposits. 2. Bank‚Äôs Lending Strategy Banks adjust savings interest based on how much liquidity (cash) they need. If banks need deposits, they increase savings interest rates to attract more funds. 3. Market Competition Neo-banks and digital-first banks often offer higher interest or better features to compete with traditional banks. 4. Type of Account Some banks have tiered interest rates (e.g., higher rates for balances above ‚Çπ1 lakh). Zero-balance or salary accounts might offer f",

Although credit cards are an excellent financial tool, overusing them can be very harmful. Consider the real-life example of Scams like these: Increasing Credit Card limit scam and Credit Card Activation Scam which wreaked havoc in people‚Äôs lives. Credit Cards can even put you in a never-ending debt spiral and harm your finances if you aren‚Äôt careful when using them. Below are some of the reasons why you should be careful when using or applying for a credit card. High-interest charges If you fail to pay your credit card bill before the due date, the amount is carried forward, and interest is charged to it. Credit card interest rates can be as high as 3% per month, which aggregate to 36% per annum. If there is any unpaid amount, the interest aggregates and can become a burden on you. Credit Card Fees Even though credit card looks like a simple instrument, they have a lot of hidden costs which often go unnoticed by you. Some of the common costs are joining fees, renewal fees, and processing fees. If you end up paying your bill late, the banks charge a penalty and late payment fees on top of the interest on the bill amount. Sometimes, if you repeatedly pay your credit card bills late, banks can reduce your credit limit, which will affect your credit score. Cash Advance Fees When you withdraw cash using a credit card, you will be charged with high cash advance fees and interest rates, starting from the date of withdrawal. This makes it an expensive option compared to other cash alternatives. Example: If you withdraw ‚Çπ10,000 using your credit card, you may incur a 3% fee (‚Çπ300) plus daily interest of 2-3%, significantly increasing the repayment amount over time. Risk of Dependency Credit cards can lead to a spending dependency, as they offer easy access to credit. This may encourage overspending, pushing users into a debt cycle that becomes hard to break. Example: A user relying on a credit ",

    "answer": "What Is Savings Account: Types & Benefits Of Savings AccountMarch 25, 2025Remuneration, Salary, And Compensation ‚Äì Definition, Meaning, and TypesMarch 27, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle Important Things to Know About Salary Slip A salary pay slip is a document that every salaried individual receives from his or her employer, but not many are aware of its importance. Do common terms like gross salary, tax deductions, and reimbursements often leave you confused? Worry not! Here, we cover the crucial aspects related to a salary slip. What Is a Salary Slip? It is a document that every company is liable to provide to its employees every month. The salary payslip includes information regarding the employee‚Äôs deductions and basic salary for a given month. It works as proof of salary payment and is generally provided by employers as both soft and hard copies. Salary Slip Components A pay slip gives you a clear picture of how much salary you get in hand, what kind of allowances and incentives your employer offers, and various other details. Additionally, you can use the document to know the available tax deductions. Here is a list of the main components of a salary slip / pay slip. Income statements: Basic salary House Rent Allowance (HRA) Dearness Allowance (DA); it is only for public sector employees Medical Allowance (MA) Conveyance Allowance (CA) Special Allowance (SA) In-hand salary Cost to Company (CTC) Deductions: Professional tax Employee Provident Fund (EPF); it is only for private sector employees Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) Difference Between CTC and in-hand salary CTC is the total amount the company spends on an employee. It includes HRA, CA, medical expenses, gratuity, EPF, and other allowances. It depends on a variety of factors, which affect your net salary. You can consider CTC as the employer‚Äôs total spending on hiring an employee. The gross salary is the amount you get before deductions. The employer subtracts gratuity and PF from this income. The gross salary is not reflected in the pay slip. It is only mentioned in your offer letter. Finally, the amount you receive after the tax and other deductions is known as take-home or in-hand salary. The in-hand salary is always lower than the CTC, as you receive it after deduction. Let us understand the differences with illustrations. Salary Slip Example If you are based in Delhi and your CTC is ‚Çπ94,100 per month, then the value of the pay slip component will be as follows: Salary Slip Structure in India Another example of a computer generated payslip: Details About Salary Slip Components The income section of the pay slip includes components, like: 1. Basic salary It is the basic element of your salary, constituting up to 50% of your total pay. At the beginning of your career, this section includes a higher amount, but as you grow and reach a higher designation, the basic component becomes lower to ensure that it remains less than your total allowance. It is advisable to negotiate for a higher basic pay. 2. Dearness Allowance (DA) DA is an allowance, which public sector employers pay to their employees to tackle the effects of inflation. As this amount is based on the cost of living, it may vary as per the location. DA is a specific percentage of your basic pay, and it is taxable. 3. House Rent Allowance (HRA) The employee pay slip also includes HRA, which is the allowance employers pay to the employees who live in rented accommodation. If you are currently living in metro cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, or Chennai, the HRA will be 50% of your basic pay. It is 40% for any other city. 4. Conveyance Allowance (CA) CA is the sum companies pay to employees to travel for work. Until 2018, you could get a yearly tax exemption of up to ‚Çπ19,200, but now it is not available anymore. Instead, you get a standard deduction of ‚Çπ50,000. 5. Medical Allowance Employers pay this allowance to every worker during their employment tenure to cover medical expenses. This also comes under the standard deduction. 6. Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) Employers pay this amount for the travel expenses of yourself and your family during holiday leave. It generally covers only the railway and flight costs for traveling within India. You need to submit the proof of travel to receive the LTA. You can also get a tax exemption on the amount, but for only up to two holidays in a four-year block. 7. Special Allowance (SA) SA is another allowance included in your monthly pay slip, and its value depend",

Well, you‚Äôve come to the right place. In this article, we‚Äôre going to delve into the world of medical benefits and their tax implications. We‚Äôll explore what medical allowances are, how they work, and why they matter. So whether you‚Äôre an employee wondering about the perks of having medical allowances or an employer trying to navigate the intricacies of offering such benefits, sit back and get ready for a crash course on understanding the ins and outs of medical allowances in salary! What is Medical Allowance in Salary? Medical allowance refers to a fixed allowance paid to employees by their companies on a monthly basis, regardless of whether they submit bills to substantiate their medical expenses or not. On the other hand, medical reimbursement involves reimbursements made to employees against specific medical bills they submit, subject to entitlement. In order to benefit from tax incentives, employees must submit monthly bills for medical reimbursement equivalent to the incurred expenses. Under the Income Tax Act, medical allowance is not classified as an allowance that qualifies for exemption. As a result, medical allowance is fully taxable. However, employees can claim a tax benefit of up to Rs. 15,000 under medical reimbursement by providing valid bills or supporting documents. What Is the Difference Between Medical Allowance and Medical Reimbursement? Medical allowance and medical reimbursement are terms often used interchangeably, but they actually have different implications for tax purposes under the Income Tax Act of 1961. Experts recommend referring to the medical component of an employee‚Äôs salary as ‚Äúmedical reimbursement‚Äù rather than ‚Äúmedical allowance‚Äù because the latter is usually taxable unless there are specific exemptions. Under the Income Tax Act, medical reimbursement falls under Section 80D, and the maximum amount allowed per year is Rs. 15,000. It‚Äôs crucial for employees to timely submit their medical reimbursement bills, as failure to do so may result in 30% of the Rs. 15,000 becoming taxable. However, employees can claim back 30% of the deducted amount when they file their tax returns. To ensure compliance, auditors and officials from the IT department closely examine medical reimbursements. Employers are responsible for making these reimbursements to employees once valid bills are provided to claim the tax-exempt status. Notably, failure to deduct taxes on amounts without submitted invoices may lead to penalties related to Tax Deducted at Source (TDS). Types of Medical Allowances Depending on the company policy and nature, medical allowances fall into 3 categories: Fixed Medical Allowance, Mediclaim Policy and Medical Reimbursement. Let‚Äôs learn them in detail: Fixed Medical Allowance: This refers to a fixed amount paid by employers to employees as part of their salary. Irrespective of whether this amount is spent on medical costs or not, it is taxable. For example, if an individual‚Äôs salary includes a medical allowance of Rs. 5,000, they will be taxed if their total income falls under the taxable income bracket for that financial year. Mediclaim Policy: Health Insurance: Employers often provide a mediclaim policy exclusively for the employee. Employers can claim this amount in their corporate return. Medical Reimbursement: In this case, employees are required to submit medical bills, including the cost of medicines, to their employers. Employers then reimburse the claims after verifying the bills on an actual basis. Latest Update on Medical Reimbursement In the budget for the financial year 2018-19, the Finance Ministry of India reintroduced the standard deduction under the Income Tax Act, eliminating the medical reimbursement of Rs. 15,000 and travel allowance of Rs. 19,200. However, the medical allowance now falls under the standard deduction, which was raised from an initial Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 50,000 per year, effective in 2019. The standard deduction refers to a flat deduction from the gross salary that is not subject to tax. It can be used to lower taxable income and reduce the total tax liability. Salaried individuals and pensioners can benefit from this deduction. It is important to note that taxpayers following the new tax regime cannot claim the standard deduction under Secti",

    "question": "Personal Loan vs Home Loan ‚Äì Which One is Better?",
    "answer": "How to Get an Instant Personal Loan Without Income Proof?September 26, 20245 Best Credit Card for Insurance Payments ‚Äì Top Options & BenefitsOctober 9, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle When you‚Äôre in need of extra cash, it can be tough to decide whether a personal loan or a home loan is the right choice. Each loan type serves a different purpose, and the details can be confusing. Are you looking to buy your dream home or just need funds for a personal expense? Understanding the differences between a personal loan and a home loan is important for making the right choice. In this article, we‚Äôll break down everything you need to know- from loan amounts to interest rates, so you can confidently decide which loan suits your needs best. Difference Between Home Loan and Personal Loan To break down the comparison between personal loans and home loans, let‚Äôs start with a clear overview of their key differences. Criteria Home Loan Personal Loan Loan Amount Higher amounts, typically used for buying property. You can borrow anywhere from ‚Çπ10 lakh to ‚Çπ5 crore or more, depending on the property value. Smaller amounts, usually ranging from ‚Çπ50,000 to ‚Çπ40-50 lakh, based on your income and credit score. Collateral You‚Äôll need to pledge your property as collateral, which is why it‚Äôs called a secured loan. No need for collateral. Personal loans are unsecured, which makes them easier to obtain if you don‚Äôt have assets to pledge. Sum Involved Typically, higher because the loan is linked to a property purchase, which usually requires a significant investment. Smaller sums, designed for short-term financial needs like medical emergencies, weddings, or travel. Tenure Home loans are spread over a long period, usually between 10-30 years, making them easier to repay in smaller instalments. Personal loans have a shorter repayment period, usually ranging from 1-5 years, meaning you‚Äôll pay higher EMIs over a shorter time. Interest Rates Interest rates on home loans are lower, generally between 6%-10%, because the loan is secured by your property. Personal loans come with higher interest rates, typically between 10%-24%, as there‚Äôs no collateral involved. Eligibility You‚Äôll need a stable income, good credit history, and the property itself plays a big role in the approval process. While income and credit score are important, personal loans are usually more lenient. If your credit score is decent, you‚Äôre likely to get approval. Credit Score Your credit score matters, but having property as collateral can balance things out even if your score isn‚Äôt perfect. A good credit score is crucial here, as personal loans are unsecured. The higher your score, the better your chances of getting a lower interest rate. Processing Time Home loans take longer to process, sometimes weeks, due to property evaluation, legal checks, and extensive paperwork. Personal loans are processed quickly, often within 24-48 hours, since there‚Äôs no property involved. Documentation You‚Äôll need several documents, including property papers, income proof, and tax returns. The process is more complex. Personal loans require minimal documentation, such as proof of income and identity, making the process much faster. EMI Payments Monthly payments are lower, thanks to the long tenure, but you‚Äôll end up paying more interest in total over the loan period. EMIs are higher because the repayment term is shorter, but you clear the loan faster, paying less total interest. Fees and Charges Home loans come with various charges- processing fees, legal fees, stamp duty, and sometimes insurance premiums. For personal loans, you‚Äôll only face a processing fee, which is much simpler and less costly overall. Foreclosure/Prepayment Charges Home loans often carry hefty prepayment charges, usually 2%-3% of the outstanding amount. Personal loans either have minimal or no prepayment charges, making it easier to clear the loan early if you wish. Tax Benefits You can claim tax deductions on both the principal and interest paid under Sections 80C and 24(b) of the Income Tax Act. Unfortunately, personal loans don‚Äôt offer any tax benefits, regardless of how you use the funds. Penalty Missing a home loan EMI can lead to hefty penalties, legal action, and even the risk of losing your property. Personal loan penalties are lighter, but consistent missed payments will still affect your credit scor What is Home Loan? A home loan is a type of secured loan that helps you buy or build a home. Essentially, the property you‚Äôre",

    "question": "Credit Card Settlement: What is It & What‚Äôs the Process?",
    "answer": "15 Best Rewards Credit Cards in India 2025September 1, 2024What Happens if I Don‚Äôt Use My Credit Card?September 3, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle If the mounting pile of credit card dues is making you anxious, and you cannot pay off the debt no matter what you do, it may be time for credit card settlement. But what is it, and how does this process work? What is the credit card settlement process? Keep reading to learn more. What is a Credit Card Settlement? If you miss a credit card payment, the bank might seek to recover a portion of the amount you owe, even if it‚Äôs not the full balance. To resolve the debt, you can negotiate with your credit card issuer to pay less than the total outstanding amount, which will help you clear the debt more quickly. Alternatively, the bank might agree to stop charging interest on the remaining balance. How Does Credit Card Settlement Work? Settling credit card debt requires thoughtful planning, a well-executed strategy, and a clear grasp of the risks and benefits involved. Here‚Äôs an overview of how the credit card settlement process typically unfolds: Negotiating with the card issuer The cardholder and the credit card issuer engage in discussions to adjust the outstanding balance. This usually involves presenting evidence of financial difficulties and making a strong case for why the issuer should agree to accept a reduced payment. Lump-sum payment Instead of continuing with potentially burdensome monthly instalments, the cardholder makes a one-time payment that‚Äôs lower than the total amount owed. This agreed-upon lump sum settles the debt. Impact on credit score Although settling can provide immediate financial relief, it may have a negative impact on your CIBIL score . The settlement will be noted on your credit report, which might cause future lenders to view your creditworthiness cautiously. Credit Card Settlement Process Grasping the credit card settlement process is crucial for anyone looking to tackle their outstanding credit card debt. Written Agreement It‚Äôs essential to have every detail, such as the settled amount and payment timeline, documented in writing. This ensures transparency and meets legal requirements, creating a binding contract between both parties. Making the Payment The cardholder is responsible for paying the settled amount, whether as a lump sum or in agreed-upon instalments, following the terms outlined in the agreement. Account Closure After the payment, the account is closed, and the credit report notes the settlement. This closure signifies the end of a well-managed process, though it comes with a potential impact on the CIBIL score. Is Credit Card Settlement Beneficial? Credit card settlement is not the best option as it is a sign that you are declaring bankruptcy, which can affect your credit rating and further lower your chances of getting a loan. If you‚Äôve struggled to pay off an overdue bill for an extended period, considering a settlement should be your final option. You can settle the amount in one lump sum or explore a workout agreement to manage the payment. However, below are some benefits of credit card settlement that you cannot ignore: It can save you money. Paying a lump sum or setting up a workout agreement with the bank can help you get out of debt faster. You‚Äôll no longer have to deal with calls from the bank asking you to settle your payments. Does Credit Card Settlement Affect Your Credit Rating? Opting for credit card settlement may offer relief to those struggling with overwhelming debt, but it can seriously harm your credit score. Let‚Äôs explore its implications: Immediate Impact Settling a credit card debt can lead to a sharp decline in your CIBIL score. Since the entire amount owed isn‚Äôt repaid, it leaves a negative mark on your credit record. Long-Term Effects The drop in your CIBIL score can have enduring repercussions, making it more difficult to secure credit in the future. Lenders might perceive you as a higher risk, whether you‚Äôre applying for a new credit card or a loan. Recovery Time Restoring your credit score after a settlement can take years of disciplined financial behaviour, including timely payments and careful management of your credit. Conclusion In conclusion, going for a credit card settlement is not the best option and should only be kept as a last resort if no other options are left for you. To avoid falling prey to credit card settlement, it‚Äôs wiser to get a credit card that has multiple uses so that you don‚Äôt ",

    "question": "What is the Difference Between Wages and Salary?",
    "answer": "4 Best RuPay Credit Cards for Travel in 2025May 7, 2023How Much Money Do You Need to Retire?May 16, 2023 difference-between-wages-and-salary‚Äã Table of Contents Toggle When discussing employment, it is important to understand the difference between wages and salary. While these two terms are often used interchangeably, there is a distinct difference between them that is important for any worker or employer to understand. This article will explore what exactly the differences are, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. What are Wages? Wages are paid by an employer to the worker depending on the total hours spent doing the job and the work completed during those hours by them. They are flexible and can be changed based on the work completed and the hours spent doing the job. Usually, production industry workers are given daily remuneration and wages. Although paid based on hourly work, one can be paid wages for a specific time, like the decided amount for the month or week. Since wages are paid based on the hours spent doing the job and the work done, higher work hours mean you will get paid more. And an absence of work hours means you won‚Äôt get the wages for that day. Advantages of Wages Below are some of the main benefits of wages: More Work Flexibility: Employees working based on wages can work based on their selected hours. Further, since wages are earned based on hours worked, working overtime can help you earn more. Less Work Responsibility: There are fewer obligations and work responsibilities for workers working on wages. Since work is done based on hours, employers assign work that‚Äôs feasible to complete within those hours. No Binding Contracts: Legally, no contracts can bind a worker on wages to stay with the firm. The individual is allowed to change jobs as they, please. Disadvantages of Wages While there are advantages of wages, it also comes with some disadvantages, such as: Pay Cuts: Workers on wages get paid for every hour they work, and most of the time, these hours are not fixed. Firms or companies that are not established may even cut work hours to reduce their expenses. No Employee Benefits: Workers on wages do not get employee benefits, such as paid leaves, insurance, access to provident funds, or travel expense reimbursements. What is a Salary? A salary is a decided amount of money given to an employee of a company every month in exchange for their work and services provided to the employer. It‚Äôs an income negotiated between the employee and employer when hiring and can be increased yearly based on performance. Salary is usually decided based on the employee‚Äôs roles, responsibilities, experience, and qualifications. Unlike wages, salary is a predetermined amount given to the employee regardless of the hours worked. Advantages of a Salary Consistent Pay Calculation: Fair compensation is given to employees. Further, the accounting department in the company also benefits because of the uniformity of pay calculation where they are better able to issue everyone cheques a regular intervals. Compensated for Responsibilities: Since salaried employees have more responsibilities where they might have to work extra hours on unofficial times or weekends, they are compensated for that with bonuses or other perks. Employee Benefits: A salaried employee can enjoy all the employee perks like paid leaves, bonuses, insurance, remote working, and a flexible work schedule. Some companies even cover commutation and accommodation costs. Disadvantages of a Salary No Overtime Pay: While the pay is consistent for salaried employees, it‚Äôs also fixed, and there‚Äôs no additional income for overtime. Odd Working Hours: Sometimes, the salaried professional has to work overtime on odd hours, on weekends, or even during their time off. This may disrupt the employee‚Äôs work-life balance, and sometimes even their physical and mental health is at stake due to improper schedules. Missed Bonuses: It so may happen that an employee won‚Äôt receive their yearly bonus if they do not reach their performance benchmark, even after completing more hours. What‚Äôs the Difference Between Wages and Salary? So, what makes wages and salaries differ from each other? Here are some points of differences you should be aware of: Differences Wages Salary Skills Workers on wages may or may not require a good educational degree Professionals should hold a degree, certain skill sets, and sometimes even a license Cost Structure Erratic, depends on the hour",

    "question": "What Is UPI Payment and How Does UPI Work?",
    "answer": "Open Savings Account OnlineJune 7, 2024What Is a Debit Card? Applying Online and Other Important InformationJune 14, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle UPI or the United Payments Interface has played a vital role in enabling the India‚Äôs vision of digital India for all sectors possible. The UPI‚Äôs success is so humongous that the Indians did 20.44 Lakh Crores rupee worth of transactions on UPI in May 2024 alone. The UPI system allows instant money transfer between bank accounts using one‚Äôs mobile phone. Thanks to their easy operation, UPI apps have helped millions of Indians make cashless transactions, and their usage has gone up significantly during the pandemic period. What Is UPI? A Unified Payment Interface (UPI) is a smartphone application through which you can transfer money between bank accounts using a single window. The system is straightforward to use, as it eliminates the need to enter bank details or other sensitive information each time you initiate a transaction. The UPI interface is also a real-time payment system. It enables peer-to-peer inter-bank transfers securely by using a two-factor authentication process. All the payments on the interface are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), making it safe to use for everyone. Furthermore, there is no charge for transferring money using the United Payments Interface, another factor behind its widespread adoption. Who Introduced UPI in India? UPI is a real-time payments system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), The Reserve Bank of India and the Indian Banks Association (IBA). NPCI is the firm that also handles the RuPay payments infrastructure that enables banks to interconnect and transfer funds, similar to Visa and MasterCard. The Immediate Payments Service (IMPS) is also an initiative of NPCI, and UPI is considered its advanced version. The pilot system was launched in India in April 2016, after which various banks in the country started upgrading their interface in August 2016. What Are the Services Offered on the UPI Payments System? The United Payments Interface offers multiple services under one umbrella app. For instance, not only can you send and receive money on your UPI app, but you can also check your account balance and retrieve your transaction history. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the key services available on UPI: Check your account balance. View the recent transactions made through your account using a UPI-enabled app. Request money by entering the amount and the virtual address of the payer. This is extremely useful for small business owners and eCommerce players. Link multiple accounts with a single UPI app for easy money management. Pay money instantly and seamlessly using the recipient‚Äôs: Virtual address Account number and IFSC Mobile number and MMID Aadhar number You can also pay by scanning a QR Code. What Is UPI ID and PIN? A UPI ID is a unique identification code for a bank account. It consists of your mobile number and the app name, with an @ symbol in between. The ID can be used to send and receive funds using your bank account through a UPI-enabled app. A UPI PIN is a 4- or 6-digit personal identification number that must be entered to authorise money transfer via UPI. How Can You Create Your UPI PIN? Before you make your first UPI transaction, you‚Äôll be required to set your UPI PIN. Below, you can see the steps for setting up your UPI PIN. A word of caution ‚Äì do not share your UPI PIN with anyone as it is used to authorise all your bank transactions. To generate or set up your UPI PIN, you first need to sign up for UPI as a payment mode at your bank. Once done, follow these steps to generate a UPI PIN: Download the UPI app of your choice- BHIM UPI, Google Pay, Paytm, etc. Scroll to the ‚ÄòBank Account‚Äô section on the app. Now tap the bank account for which you want to set a UPI PIN. You will see a ‚ÄòSET‚Äô option if you‚Äôve never set a UPI PIN for the bank account. If you‚Äôre regenerating your UPI PIN, there will be a ‚ÄòRESET‚Äô or similar option. Use your debit card to enter the last six digits and expiry date. Wait for a few seconds to receive an OTP from your bank on the registered mobile number. Enter the OTP and the UPI PIN you want to set for the account on the next screen before clicking on ‚ÄòSUBMIT‚Äô. That‚Äôs it. You‚Äôll receive a message from your bank on the successful generation or regeneration of your UPI PIN that you can now use to send money or make payments from your bank account directly.

    "question": "NPS vs PPF: A Comparision Between the Two Popular Government Schemes",
    "answer": "Public Provident Fund ‚Äì Meaning, Features, and How to Invest in PPF?June 27, 2023Portfolio Diversification: Types, Strategies, Benefits & LimitationJune 27, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle The National Pension Scheme (NPS) and Public Provident Fund (PPF) are government securities launched to encourage long-term savings for retirement. Although both offer tax benefits, the schemes are very different from each other in terms of returns, tenure, maturity benefit, and lock-in period. Read to find out the differences between these two popular government schemes. What is the National Pension Scheme (NPS)? NPS is a government-launched voluntary retirement scheme. Managed by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and Central Government, NPS offers dual benefits of investment and pension. Account opening: There are two kinds of accounts in NPS, namely, tier 1 and tier 2 accounts. Tier 1 account is a pension account with a minimum investment of Rs 500, and withdrawals are subject to certain restrictions. Tier 2 is a voluntary account with a minimum investment of Rs 250 and no withdrawal restriction. To open a tier 2 account, you must have an active tier 1 account. Documents required to open an NPS account: To open an NPS account, you require an NPS application form and KYC documents such as PAN Card, Aadhar Card, Passport, and bank account details. Returns: When you deposit money in any of the NPS accounts, it is invested in market-linked securities such as equity and debt. Hence the returns of NPS also fluctuate based on market volatility. Entry age and tenure: The minimum entry age for NPS is 18 years, and your investment matures only when you turn 60. This means your investment is locked-in until retirement. Maturity benefit: Upon retirement, 60% of the investment can be withdrawn in lumpsum, which is entirely tax-free. The rest 40% should be used to buy an annuity plan. This annuity plan will pay a pension monthly for a lifetime. If you want to withdraw prematurely, the maximum amount you can withdraw is 25% of the corpus. In case you want to opt out of the scheme, you can get a maximum of 20% of the corpus, and the rest, 80%, must be used to buy an annuity. Tax benefit: Investment in NPS up to Rs 2 lakh per annum qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C and 80CCD of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The pension you receive from the annuity plan is taxable as per your income tax slab rate when you receive it. What is the Public Provident Fund (PPF)? PPF is a small savings scheme launched in 1968 to encourage long-term savings. The following are the features of the scheme. Minimum and maximum investment: The minimum investment is Rs 500, and the maximum is Rs 1.5 lakhs per annum. To keep the account active, you must invest at least once a year. Documents required to open a PPF account: You will need to submit a duly filled and signed PPF application form, passport-size photographs, identity proof such as PAN Card, Driving License, Passport, Aadhar Card, Voter ID, address proof such as Passport, Aadhar Card, Driving License, utility bills, and nominee declaration form. Account opening: To open a PPF account, you can go to an authorized bank or a post office. You can only open an individual account. Interest: PPF pays a fixed interest of 7.1% per annum. The interest will directly get credited to your PPF account. Tenure: The tenure of the scheme is fifteen years. This means your investment will mature only after 15 years, and you will receive your investment proceeds after this tenure. Withdrawal: You can partially withdraw your PPF investment after 6th year from account opening. Loan against PPF: The scheme also gives you a loan against your PPF investment between the 3rd and 6th year. A maximum of 25% of the amount will be given as a loan for a tenure of three years. You can take a second loan before 6th year if you repay the first loan. Nomination: You can nominate a person for your PPF investment. They will receive the investment proceeds after your death. Tax benefit: The investment, interest, and maturity proceeds are all exempt from tax as PPF falls under EEE (exempt exempt exempt) category. Similarities between NPS and PPF Following are the similarities between NPS and PPF. Long-term investment: NPS and PPF are long-term investments with an investment horizon of 15 years or more. Both investments have a lock-in period until they mature. Retirement fund: The government has introduced both investments w",

    "question": "How to Pay Credit Card Bill from Another Credit Card",
    "answer": "How to Check Credit Card BalanceAugust 23, 2024How to Add/Register and Link Your Mobile Number With Aadhaar CardAugust 23, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle A credit card is one of the most useful financial tools available. It is a convenient method to manage your credit debts and improve your credit score, provided you pay the credit card bills on time. But what if you are not able to pay the credit card bill for the month on time due to an unprecedented emergency? Can you pay a credit card bill from another credit card? Can We Pay a Credit Card Bill from Another Credit Card? Yes, it is possible to pay a credit card bill using another credit card, but it typically involves a few extra steps. Most banks do not allow direct payments from one credit card to another. Instead, you can use a balance transfer option to transfer the outstanding balance from one credit card to another. This is often done to take advantage of lower interest rates or promotional offers on the new card. Alternatively, you could use a cash advance from one credit card to pay the bill on another, but this approach is usually costly due to high interest rates and fees associated with cash advances. Another option is using a third-party service like a digital wallet, which allows you to pay with a credit card and then transfer the funds to pay off the bill. However, these methods should be used cautiously, as they can lead to more debt if not managed properly. Nevertheless, you can pay one credit card bill from another credit card, but there are different methods with which you can do so. Let‚Äôs explore them in detail. How to Pay a Credit Card Bill from Another Credit Card? There are different ways to pay a credit card bill from another credit card, here‚Äôs how: Through Balance Transfer A balance transfer allows you to shift the outstanding amount from one credit card to another, either in full or partially, depending on your needs. This process lets you pay off the previous card‚Äôs balance using the new card. The new card often comes with a lower interest rate and may offer an interest-free period for the first few months, making it easier to manage repayments. When considering a balance transfer, keep the following in mind: A fee of 3%-5% typically applies when transferring your balance from one Credit Card to another. Weigh this cost against the benefits to determine if the transfer is worthwhile. If you fail to make timely payments, you‚Äôll incur interest on the remaining balance, even during the interest-free period. Choosing a balance transfer might cause a slight dip in your credit score. Ensure your credit utilisation ratio remains well below the credit limit during transfer. Be aware that the lower interest rate on the new card is often promotional, lasting between 6 and 18 months, after which the standard rate will apply. Through Cash Withdrawal A cash advance could be an option if you‚Äôre looking for a fast way to pay a credit card bill using another credit card. With a cash advance, you can withdraw money from an ATM that allows credit card transactions up to a certain limit set by your card issuer and use those funds to pay your bill. However, consider these points before opting for a cash advance: Cash advances come with a higher interest rate, often exceeding the rates for regular credit card purchases. You‚Äôll be charged a cash advance fee, typically around 2.5% to 3% of the amount you withdraw. Using an ATM cash advance for credit card bill payments can be costly, so carefully assess your financial situation before choosing this option. Through Wallets Digital wallets offer a convenient way to store money online, making them an easy option for various payments, including paying your credit card bills. If you need to use one credit card to pay the bill of another, you can load funds into your preferred e-wallet app, whether it‚Äôs a third-party app or one backed by your bank. The process of adding money to an e-wallet using your credit card is quick and straightforward. Simply enter your card details, authorise the transaction with an OTP sent to your registered mobile number, and the funds will be available in the wallet. You can then effortlessly use this balance to pay off the bill with another credit card. Through a Personal Loan Another viable method to pay a credit card bill is by getting a personal loan. This option is beneficial if you have substantial balances with high interest rates, as personal loans often come with lower interest r",

    "answer": "How to Make Money with Gold: A Complete Guide to Investments and ReturnsJuly 11, 2024Cost of Living in Pune ‚Äì For Bachelors, Family, Student, and Couples 2025July 12, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Businesses can accept payments in different ways, which include cash, card, and cheque payments. Moreover, advanced methods like digital fund transfers, mobile payments, and other online payments are becoming popular by the day. Today, customers expect speed, wider choice, higher security, and ease of use while making payments. However, business owners may be spoilt for choice with a wide range of accepting payments that are available today. Different Types of Payment Methods Traditionally, users preferred card payments for their purchases. Although these are some of the safest methods, several other safer, quicker, and simpler alternatives are now available. Here are the various types of payment systems to choose from. Cash Cash was the most common method used by consumers to pay for their purchases until the coronavirus pandemic hit the world. It is preferred to make small payments like a train ticket or paying for a bar of chocolate from the corner store. Cash payments help people to keep track of their expenses and cut back if required. However, they may need to visit the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) or the bank to withdraw the cash, which may be slightly inconvenient. Cheques This mode of payment is gradually becoming redundant as newer and more convenient options become available. A cheque is a paper voucher linked to the holders‚Äô bank accounts and commonly used by traders or for bill payments. Users can issue a cheque to the vendors; however, it is important that they have the required amount in their account for its clearance. Debit card payments Debit cards are linked to the holders‚Äô bank account. When the users pay for their purchase with these cards, the amount is debited from their account and transferred to the vendors‚Äô accounts. There are three primary types of cards, which include Visa, Maestro, and MasterCard. Debit cards are an alternative to carrying cash. Credit card payments These are like debit cards; however, the difference is that the users enjoy a certain credit period. This means they can pay for their purchases now and repay this money later. Credit cards come with a pre-determined limit, which is the maximum amount they can spend. This can be a beneficial option to split the cost of high-value purchases but there is the risk of users spending more than they can afford and later struggling to pay the bill. Prepaid cards Prepaid cards are another cash alternative and can be used as a debit or credit card. The difference is that a certain amount is pre-loaded to the card and users pay the required amount until the limit is exhausted. Prepaid cards eliminate the risk of over-spending but may come with certain fees. Contactless payments Such methods are gaining popularity because of their ease of use and faster completion of transactions. Using the near field technology, users simply tap their cards over the reader to complete the payment. Consumers can use credit, debit, or prepaid cards to pay for their purchases. Offline bank transfers People in remote locations may not be able to use online methods to make payments due to a lack of connectivity or knowledge. Offline bank transfers via National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) and Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) are available. They may visit the nearest branch to complete the payment. Electronic bank transfers These transfers are used to move funds from one account to another via online networks. Such transactions replace paper-based transfers and human intermediaries. The payments can be made to the same bank or different institutions. Such transfers only require a working bank account. Online banking Online payment methods can be used to pay for all types of purchases. Before using this service, users have to sign up with their banks. Once this is done, they can pay any amount to anyone directly from their accounts. Users can also set up standing payment instructions and direct debits to friends, family, or businesses. Email Another quick and simple method for online payments is clicking on the link received via email. The vendors create the payment link and send it to the customers who can use it to complete the transaction. The customers are directed to a secure page to make the payment. These links accept payments using debit or credit card",

    "answer": "Secured Loans and Unsecured Loans: Meaning, Types, and DifferenceAugust 23, 2024Assets and Liabilities: What Are They? Know Difference between ThemAugust 24, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle ‚ÄòLiving for the Gram‚Äô is fast becoming a norm, and a lot of youngsters are following this trending lifestyle by the day. Even if you do not know what it means, at some point, you must have done something just to put it on Instagram, too. It sounds like a fun practice, but it might be making you spend a lot of money unnecessarily. A recent study conducted in America revealed that 33% of people are spending more money because of what their friends are posting on social media. It can be said with some certainty that this is true for Indians as well. Haven‚Äôt you ever thought of going on a Europe trip or buying expensive gadgets right after your friends posted it on Instagram? Is it worth it? Spending money on something just because someone else did and posted about it on Instagram is no way to live a healthy life. Assume you are currently making ‚Çπ50,000 per month for working 22 days and 8 hours a day. So, you are working 176 hours a month and making ‚Çπ285 every hour. Now, imagine your friend Shweta just posted a picture of her holding the latest smartphone. Looking at the picture, you feel like buying a brand-new smartphone too. You quickly message her, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great phone, how much did it cost?‚Äù She replies ‚Äú‚Çπ75,000.‚Äù Now that is around 260 hours of you working! Ask yourself, ‚Äúis it worth it?‚Äù The answer will be, ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù But does that mean you can never buy that phone or go on a trip to Europe? Of course, you can. Imagine the flood of likes and comments on Instagram! All it takes is saving regularly, learning how to invest money, and being patient. Meeting short-term goals with the right investments Before you start investing, you must understand the power of compounding. Some investment products offer you compound interest, which means you get an interest on the principal amount and on the previously accumulated interest. This is what will help you fulfill your short-term goals. Here is how: If you have your eyes on a ‚Çπ75,000 smartphone, give yourself two years to accumulate that amount. Invest ‚Çπ3,000 every month in an instrument that pays 8% compound interest. At the end of two years, you will get ‚Çπ78,000 returns, and of course, the phone. Let us look at something more expensive now‚Äîa Europe trip that costs ‚Çπ4 lakhs. You can get there by saving ‚Çπ10,000 a month and investing it in a financial plan that offers 8% compound interest. In three years, you will have ‚Çπ4 lakhs (‚Çπ3.60 lakhs of principal and ‚Çπ40,000 of interest). With the money, you will get your trip and all the photos to overflow your friends‚Äô timeline with the picturesque European skyline. On the contrary, if you opted for a loan at 8% interest, it would cost you ‚Çπ4.30 lakhs (repayment of ‚Çπ4 lakhs of principal loan amount and ‚Çπ30,000 of interest payment). So, by investing smartly and avoiding taking a loan, you could practically save ‚Çπ70,000. Now that you know why it is best to save and invest your hard-earned money, read on to understand how to invest efficiently. Why is investing important? If you think saving money is enough, you might not be considering inflation. The value of money decreases over time due to inflation, thereby reducing your purchasing power. So, saving money does not help you unless you allow it to grow. When you put your savings in investment options that offer compound interest and hold it for the long term, the money will accumulate into a significant fortune. The first step to learning how to start investing is by getting into the game early. The longer you stay invested, the greater will be your profits. Things to consider before investing Investing your hard-earned money without establishing a proper plan may not bring good results. So, you need an investment plan that can work. Here are four things to consider before investing. 1. Budget You should always invest as per your budget and financial goals. If you want to build a retirement corpus, it is wise to start investing 10% to 15% of your annual income. For short-term goals, you can start small and decide the amount based on your objectives. 2. Investment options Here are two investment avenues that offer compound interest. Recurring deposits: It is a flexible investment option that allows you to put money as per your budget every month. A recurring deposit amount is not fixed, and it offers eas",

    "question": "Fixed Maturity Plans: Features, Pros, Cons & Investing",
    "answer": "A Comprehensive Overview to Investing in Sectoral Mutual FundsOctober 3, 2022What is Mid Cap Fund ‚Äì Overview, Features, Advantages & DisadvantagesOctober 10, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Investors find mutual fund investments more attractive for better returns and capital appreciation than traditional options like Provident Funds (PFs), National Savings Certificates (NSCs), Fixed Deposits (FDs), and so on. Fund houses or asset management companies (AMCs) manage mutual funds. They pool your money to invest it across various financial instruments. One such scheme is a fixed maturity plan (FMP) ‚Äî a close-ended debt fund that gives you a predictable rate of return. FMP in mutual funds predominantly invests in fixed income instruments whose maturity periods sync with FMP scheme tenure. This article will explore fixed maturity plans to help you make sound mutual fund investment decisions. What Are Fixed Maturity Plans In Mutual Funds? A fixed maturity plan meaning implies a fixed-tenure, close-ended mutual fund scheme with a limited investment option. It mainly invests in fixed income instruments, including commercial papers (CPs), certificates of deposit (CODs), government securities, and treasury bills. The maturity period of FMP funds could range from a few months to a few years. For instance, you have an FMP with a maturity period of 2 years. Then, your AMC would invest in debt securities with a two-year tenure, ensuring the debt instruments‚Äô maturity period does not exceed that of your FMP. How does Fixed Maturity Plan in Mutual Fund work? Different fixed-income securities with corresponding maturities make up an FMP portfolio. A fund manager makes investments in instruments so that they all mature at around the same time based on the FMP‚Äôs terms. All plan units are held until they mature on a specific date during the plan‚Äôs lifespan. Investors can therefore estimate the plan‚Äôs return rate. As you can see, the FMP funds are designed to reduce the interest rate risk. It safeguards your investments from any interest rate fluctuation during the term of the FMP scheme. Who Should Invest in FMP Funds? FMP in mutual funds is best suited for those investors who are risk averse but still want a better tax-efficient return than a regular fixed deposit (FD). Investors ready to accept continual net asset value (NAV) fluctuations can opt for a fixed maturity plan. NAV implies a mutual fund‚Äôs scheme unit price based on which mutual funds are purchased or sold. As FMP has limited liquidity with a lock-in period, investors with an urgent need of funds can consider investing their money in an FMP over the NFO maturity period. How to Invest in a Fixed Maturity Plan? Investors can invest only in a fixed maturity plan during a new fund offer (NFO) scheme by an AMC based on subscription requests. It is pertinent to note that post the NFO completion period, you cannot make any new investments in the said FMP scheme. As per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), mutual fund houses need to provide investors with ways for an early redemption from the scheme. Closed-ended schemes like FMPs can be redeemed earlier than their maturity period when they are listed on a stock exchange. You can thus buy or sell FMP units when they get listed on a recognised stock exchange. Otherwise, investors cannot freely enter or exit an FMP anytime in fixed-period mutual funds. What Are The Features of an FMP? Here are the key features of the FMP: Fixed period plans FMP funds have a fixed lock-in period during which you cannot withdraw the investment in the said scheme. The primary purpose of having rigid withdrawal guidelines for a fixed maturity plan is to generate optimum returns for the scheme during the lock-in period. You can select the FMP based on your investment goals and liquidity requirements. Investment approach Fund managers mainly invest fixed maturity plans in fixed income instruments like CODs, CPs, and good companies, which mature in line with the FMP‚Äôs maturity period. Closed-ended funds As FMP funds are closed-ended schemes, you can invest only during the initial NFO period like the FMP maturity plan 2021, and redeem the series on the scheme‚Äôs maturity. Investors who invest in FMP units via Demat mode can redeem them by selling them on the stock exchange where the FMP scheme units are listed. Minimal risk plans An FMP majorly invests in debt instruments, including treasury bills, non-convertible debentures, and related debt secur",

    "question": "The Importance of Understanding Basic Salary Calculation",
    "answer": "How to Calculate Professional Tax on Salary?May 16, 2024Best Government Investment Schemes to Invest In 2025May 24, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Salary and pension are considered essential rights of an individual‚Äôs life and liberty under the Indian Constitution. When you receive your income statement on payday, you often come across the term ‚Äúbasic salary / basic pay‚Äù highlighted. In this article, we will learn what is basic salary, and its calculation methods, factors affecting it, and its tax implications. Let‚Äôs explore this crucial component of your salary structure in detail. What is Basic Salary? Basic salary refers to a fixed amount paid to employees for their services rendered to a company. It serves as the foundation upon which most other salary components are calculated. Unlike bonuses or commissions, a basic salary does not include any additional allowances. The determination of an employee‚Äôs basic salary takes place at the time of appointment and may be subject to revision annually, particularly if the individual falls under a pay scale system. The payable basic salary varies depending on factors such as the employee‚Äôs designation, industry, and experience. Basic Salary Calculation: How to Calculate Basic Salary? To understand the concept of basic salary, employees need to be aware that it forms a vital part of their salary structure, on which various components such as PF (Provident Fund), gratuity, etc., are calculated. Companies typically use simple formulas for calculating basic salary. The formula for Calculating Annual Basic Salary is: Annual basic salary = monthly basic salary X 12 months However, it‚Äôs important to note that there is no definitive method to calculate the basic wage, as it may vary from one company to another. In practice, companies often use a reversed calculation method based on a percentage of the overall salary or CTC (Cost to Company). The basic pay is usually set at around 40% of the gross income or 50% of an individual‚Äôs CTC. Another approach to finding the basic pay is by subtracting the total allowances (such as HRA, health insurance, DA, conveyance, etc.) from the gross pay: Basic salary = Gross pay ‚Äì total allowances Alternatively, the basic salary can be calculated as a percentage of the CTC or gross pay. Online CTC calculators can be helpful in determining your salary after deducting all the necessary components without seeking assistance from anyone. Check the ‚ÄòBasic Salary‚Äô section in the salary calculator below: Ôªø How To Calculate Basic Salary As CTC Percentage? When the exact basic pay remains unknown, but the CTC and the percentage of basic pay in the CTC are known, employees can reverse-engineer their basic salary with ease. By employing the following formula, they can ascertain the value of their base salary using the percentage provided: Basic salary = Total CTC x % of Basic Salary in CTC Basic Salary Calculation Examples Suppose an employee‚Äôs annual CTC amounts to ‚Çπ10 lakhs, with the basic salary calculated at 50%. By utilizing the formula, we will calculate the basic salary in the following manner: Basic salary: = ‚Çπ10 lakhs x 50% = ‚Çπ5 lakhs What Are the Factors Affecting Basic Salary? 5 factors influence the determination of basic salary in India. Some of the key factors include: HR Policies: HR policies established by an organization can have a significant impact on the basic salary structure. Depending on these policies, a skilled employee may receive higher compensation compared to colleagues at the same level. Company Policy: Companies often set salary brackets based on factors such as market demand and supply, company turnover, product/service offerings, and more. For example, the basic salary offered by an IT firm will differ from that of a small content-writing firm. Designation: An employee‚Äôs designation plays a vital role in determining the basic pay. Individuals with experience and qualifications are likely to receive a better pay scale than their counterparts with less experience or qualifications. Location or Country: Social and economic factors specific to a location or country can also contribute to salary discrepancies. For instance, the basic salary in India may differ significantly from that in Europe due to varying living costs and economic conditions. Industry or Sector: Different industries or sectors often have varying salary structures. The base salary of an individual working in the media sector, for instance, will differ from that of so",

Under this section, premium paid for purchasing health insurance for self, spouse, dependent children, and parents is eligible for tax deduction. The maximum deduction that can be claimed depends on the members covered under the policy and their age. Moreover, tax deduction of up to ‚Çπ5,000 is available for health check-up expenses for self or family. Medical expenses for a disabled dependent Section 80DD exempts any expenses related to the treatment of disabled dependents. Some of these include training, nursing, and rehabilitation of dependents.

    "question": "Difference between IPO and FPO",
    "answer": "How To Create Wealth from Salary?September 11, 2024How to Block and Unblock Your Credit CardSeptember 12, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Whether your business is small, medium, or large, it will require funds for meeting regular operational expenses. Most companies raise funds either as equity or debt. Equity is promoters‚Äô capital while debt can be raised from financial institutions, and even in some cases, from friends and family. When a company raises equity, it issues shares to the investors. If you plan to invest in the stock market, you need to understand some basic terms, which include Initial Public Offering (IPO) and Follow-on Public Offer (FPO). What is an IPO? You may have often heard this abbreviation, but do you know what is an IPO in the stock market? An IPO is when a company announces offering its shares to the public for the first time. Going public means that the company will offer equity shares to the people and then, is listed on one or more of the stock exchanges like the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) or the National Stock Exchange (NSE). An IPO is one of the major sources of raising money from the public to fund the company‚Äôs projects and meet other business objectives. Significance of an IPO for the company After understanding what is an IPO stock, let us see its significance for the issuing company. At the time of commencing operations, promoters invest their personal money and also raise funds from venture capitalists, investors, and other sources including the government. However, as the business expands, these sources may not be able to meet the growing fund requirements. At this point, the company may decide to go public for the first time and get listed on one or more stock exchanges via an IPO. With an IPO, the company is able to raise money from the public to meet its growth capital requirements. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates IPO and the company once listed must meet the regulatory requirements. This ensures the management runs the business efficiently to enhance shareholders‚Äô value and prevent any losses. An IPO also increases the liquidity for the company and the shareholders as shares can be easily bought and sold on the stock exchanges. Significance of an IPO for the investors Having understood what is an IPO in the share market, let us see its benefits for the investors. If you invest in an IPO and are allotted shares, you gain partial ownership in the company based on the proportion of your investment. Moreover, if the company performs well, you may enjoy short-term listing gains or hold the shares for long-term returns. Additionally, when a company decides to go public, other options like employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) can be made available, which offer multiple benefits like profit sharing for the company‚Äôs personnel. What is an FPO? Now let us understand what is an FPO; it is a follow-up offer of shares after the IPO. The company offers additional equity shares to the public during the FPO to further diversify its equity base. Significance of an FPO for the company Companies issue an FPO to raise additional capital or to reduce their debt liabilities. They can issue an FPO either as dilutive or non-dilutive. Dilutive FPO The company issues additional shares in the stock market for the public; however, the value remains the same. A dilutive FPO decreases the share‚Äôs price and also the earnings per share (EPS) value. Non-dilutive FPO It occurs within the larger shareholders like the promoters and board of directors. They sell their shareholding in the market. A non-dilutive FPO does not increase the number of shares available for the general public but increases their value and changes the EPS. Significance of an FPO for the Investors An FPO is a relatively safer and cost-effective option when compared to an IPO. When the company issues an FPO, you already have information about its business, financial statements, management strategy, and other parameters that are important to make an informed investment decision. What is the difference between an IPO and an FPO? Every company irrespective of the size and industry requires adequate cash flows for smooth business operations and expansion activities. Promoters do not have unlimited funds, and therefore, companies issue shares to the general public to meet their fund requirements. The first issue of shares is known as an IPO and the next one is known as an FPO. Let us understand IPO vs.",

    "question": "What Are Salary Arrears in India? Meaning, Calculation, Deduction and Comparison with Pension Arrears",
    "answer": "6 Best RuPay Credit Card for Online Shopping in India 2025May 7, 2024Advance Salary Loan up to Rs. 1.5 Lakh at 0% Interest ‚Äì Jupiter MoneyMay 16, 2024 salary-arrears‚Äã Table of Contents Toggle If you are a salaried employee, you must have come across the term ‚Äúsalary arrears‚Äù in your career. But, what exactly does payment in arrears mean? It‚Äôs a bit of accounting jargon that everyone should know but is often misunderstood. Let‚Äôs break it down and look at what the term means. This article will provide details about salary arrears in India. What are Arrears in Salary? In the context of salary, an arrear is value of money that should have been paid in the past as a salary and was missed out. Arrears are payments made to compensate for not paying salaries on time. Employees are given arrears when they earn a wage increase in a month but do not receive the money in the following month. In this situation, the overdue money is referred to as arrears since it is given at a later period. Total arrears is the aggregate of all invoices that have accrued since the initial payment was due. If the product or service has been delivered and the bill payment is due after the specified time, the account is considered to be paid in arrears. A worker, for instance, gets paid in arrears since the job must be performed and finished before any compensation can be paid. A simple example of this would be; Let‚Äôs assume Ajay was supposed to get Rs. 25,000 as a salary for the month of June and he received Rs. 24,167 due to one of the days of work was not registered for attendance and it ended up being counted as a Loss of Pay. Whereas, the attendance was not marked by mistake. So this becomes a case of arrears in the salary where Ajay was supposed to get the balance amount of Rs. 833. This arrear of Rs. 833 should be processed and paid to Ajay in the next month or in the upcoming salary. Calculating Arrears in Salary There are several advantages to paying staff in arrears. It enables more equitable, equal, and precise payment and better cash flow management. Arrears are simply wage increases carried over from the previous month of payment to the current payment month. To compute arrear payments for your staff correctly, you must do the following: Begin with the usual monthly wage of the staff. Compute the sum from the conclusion of the preceding month to the effective arrears date. Deduct the sum you have previously paid up to the effective date of the arrears. The rest amount is the arrears portion. Include any bonuses, such as overtime, tips, or incentives. Payment in Arrears There are two commonly used definitions for payment arrears accounting. Arrears can be defined in two ways: Arrear Payment can relate to paying a service provider following the conclusion of the agreement‚Äôs obligations. This utilisation of arrear payment accounting suggests that reimbursement will be paid after a specified period instead of paying in advance. These same rules apply to arrear payments. Arrear payments can also relate to a company‚Äôs inability to make payments. In this circumstance, the arrear payment amount is deemed to be accruing from the deadline of the initial missed payment. When an invoice is paid in arrears, each succeeding payment is added to the previous payment until the outstanding account is ‚Äúup to date.‚Äù Payment in Arrears vs. Payment in Advance Payment in Arrears Payment in Advance An arrear payment is made after a service has already been provided. Payments are paid to salaried staff after the employees have supplied the service to the company. Advance payment is made before the service is rendered. Rent can be an instance of an advance payment because it is normally made at the beginning of the month. Other instances of arrear payments include post-paid telephone service, post-paid power bills, real estate taxes, etc. Premium payments of Insurance policies, prepaid telephone service, and leasing payments are other instances of advance payments. Arrears in Payroll An arrear is a term that is commonly used in payrolls. This context relates to compensating a person for work accomplished in a prior pay period instead of the current one. Assume, for instance, that your company pays their employees on 1st May for tasks accomplished over the whole month of April. Here, the employees are paid in arrears since they receive their payments after the task has finished. Many firms like to create a payroll schedule in this manner. When staff is paid in ar",

    "answer": "Best Gold Investment Apps To Buy Digital Gold Online in IndiaApril 1, 2025Best Bank For Salary Account In IndiaApril 2, 2025 Table of Contents Toggle In terms of employment, people in India work in both the public and private sectors. Recent estimates indicate that 6.8 million people receive government pensions, including family pensions, and that out of India‚Äôs 40 million salaried workers, nearly 5 million work for the government. Dearness Allowance (DA) is one of the components that make up salary packages. Employers in the public and private sectors are given this allowance specifically to help with the rising cost of inflation. In this article, we will dig deeper into understanding Dearness Allowance (DA) in salary. What is Dearness Allowance (DA)? DA‚Äôs full form in salary per month is Dearness Allowance. Dearness Allowance (DA) is a cost-of-living adjustment allowance given to employees to compensate for the rising prices of goods and services in an economy. It‚Äôs a percentage of the basic salary that is adjusted periodically to match inflation rates. The allowance is calculated as a percentage of the regular salary to mitigate the impact of inflation. When filing an Income Tax Return (ITR), it is mandatory to declare the tax liability associated with DA. This salary component is applicable to employees in both India and Bangladesh. Current Dearness Allowance Rate ‚ÄãAs of March 28, 2025, the Union Cabinet has approved a 2% increase in Dearness Allowance (DA) for central government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) for pensioners, raising the rate from 53% to 55% of basic pay and pension. This adjustment is effective from January 1, 2025, and aims to offset inflation impacts. Source: The Times of India This decision benefits approximately 48.66 lakh central government employees and 66.55 lakh pensioners, with an estimated annual financial impact of ‚Çπ6,614.04 crore on the exchequer. ‚ÄãHindustan Times+2The Times of India+2mint+2 The previous DA increase occurred in July 2024, when it was raised from 50% to 53% Source: The Economic Times Dearness Allowance is a cost-of-living adjustment provided to government employees and pensioners to mitigate the effects of inflation. It is revised periodically based on the All India Consumer Price Index (AICPI). For example, an employee with a basic pay of ‚Çπ40,000 will see their DA increase from ‚Çπ21,200 (at 53%) to ‚Çπ22,000 (at 55%), resulting in a monthly increase of ‚Çπ800.‚Äã It‚Äôs important to note that when DA reaches 50%, certain allowances linked to basic pay, such as House Rent Allowance (HRA), may be revised. However, specific details about these adjustments have not been provided in the current announcement.‚Äã These changes are designed to help central government employees manage the increasing cost of living. In short, this DA hike means that central government employees can look forward to a noticeable increase in their monthly salaries. How to Calculate Dearness Allowance (DA) in Salary Dearness Allowance is added to your salary along with basic salary and other components of the salary. For Central Government employees Dearness Allowance % = ((Average of AICPI (Base Year ‚Äì 2016=100) for the past 12 months -115.76)/115.76) *100 ‚ÄúThe Labour Bureau has changed the base year of the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers from 2001 to 2016. The link factor for the new series (2016=100) to the old series (2001=100) is 2.88.‚Äù ‚Äì Source For Central Public Sector Company employees Dearness Allowance % = ((Average of AICPI (Base Year ‚Äì 2016=100) for the past 3 months -126.33)/126.33) *100 Check out more data about Consumer Price Index here. For Private sector employees The specific formula for calculating DA in the private sector may not be publicly available or standardized across all private companies. Employees in the private sector are advised to refer to their company‚Äôs HR policies or consult with their HR department for detailed information on the calculation of Dearness Allowance specific to their organization. Types of Dearness Allowance There are two types of Dearness Allowance (DA) ‚Äì Industrial Dearness Allowance (IDA) and Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA). Variable Dearness Allowance (VAD) Variable Dearness Allowance (VAD) is a type of financial support given to Central Government employees in India.

    "question": "What‚Äôs the Difference Between EPF and EPS?",
    "answer": "Best Government Investment Schemes to Invest In 2025May 24, 2024Open Savings Account OnlineJune 7, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Employee Pension Scheme (EPS) are two of the most important retirement schemes in India. As an employee, it is important to understand the difference between EPF and EPS, as they both offer different benefits. This article will provide an overview of the schemes to give a comprehensive understanding of their individual merits. What is EPF Scheme? The Employees‚Äô Provident Fund (EPF) is a savings scheme introduced by the Indian Government. This scheme aims to provide financial security and stability to employees after they retire or leave their jobs. Under this scheme, employers and employees contribute a certain percentage of their salary towards the fund every month. The EPF is calculated as 12% of the employee‚Äôs basic salary plus dearness allowance. The contributions made by both employer and employee are accumulated over time with interest, providing a stable retirement fund for the employee. The interest rate on EPF varies from year to year, and you can earn a regular and fixed rate of interest that is determined by the Indian Government. What is EPS Scheme? Employee Pension Scheme (EPS) is a retirement savings plan that helps pay pensions to employees who are a part of the EPFO (Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation). The scheme benefits employees when they retire, become disabled, or die while still employed. It is designed to ensure that employees have a source of income after retirement to sustain their livelihoods. The scheme also helps employers attract and retain good employees by providing additional benefits beyond their regular salary. Employers usually administer pension schemes through trust funds managed by professional investment managers who invest the funds on behalf of members. How to calculate EPS? The Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme (EPS) is a part of the overall Employee Provident Fund (EPF) system in India. Let‚Äôs consider an example to understand the calculation of EPS in your salary. Key Points to consider before calculation: 1. The EPS contribution is 8.33% of the employee‚Äôs basic salary and Dearness Allowance (DA), subject to a maximum salary cap of ‚Çπ15,000 per month. 2. If the employee‚Äôs basic salary and DA exceed ‚Çπ15,000 per month, the EPS contribution is still calculated on ‚Çπ15,000. Example Calculation: Let‚Äôs assume an employee has: Basic Salary of ‚Çπ30,000 per month & Dearness Allowance (DA) of ‚Çπ10,000 per month Total Salary (Basic + DA): ‚Çπ40,000 per month Steps to Calculate the EPS Contribution: The maximum salary for EPS contribution is capped at ‚Çπ15,000 per month by the Government of India. Now, calculate the EPS Contribution: 8.33% of ‚Çπ15,000 (capped amount): EPS Contribution = 8.33% of ‚Çπ15,000 = 0.0833 * ‚Çπ15,000 = ‚Çπ1,249.50 Since contributions are usually rounded to the nearest rupee, the EPS contribution would be ‚Çπ1,250 per month. What‚Äôs the Difference Between EPF and EPS? The Difference Between EPF and EPS is, EPF is a plan in which both the company and the employee pay a portion of the employee‚Äôs wage. EPS, on the other hand, is exclusively contributed to by an employer. While you‚Äôre likely to get confused between these two schemes and mistake them as one, you should know they are different. There are several points of differences between EPF and EPS, such as: EPF EPS Applicability Any organisation above 20 employees is applicable for EPF Applied for people who are members of EPFO (Employee Provident Fund Organisation) Employee Eligibility All employees are eligible Employees with a salary and dearness allowance of up to ‚Çπ15,000 are eligible Employee Contribution 12% of the employee‚Äôs dearness allowance and salary. No contributions to be made by the employee Employer Contribution 3.67% of the employee‚Äôs salary & Dearness Allowance 8.33% of the employee‚Äôs salary and dearness allowance Contribution Limit 12% of the salary 8.33% on a salary of up to ‚Çπ15,000 Interest Rate Every month, the fixed interest rate is calculated and reflected by the end of a financial year Not applied Withdrawal Age Can withdraw after 58, and unemployed individuals can withdraw in a continuous trial of more than two months You start receiving a pension after the age of 58 Premature Withdrawal If specific criteria are fulfilled, partial withdrawal is allowed for exceptional cases like unemployment, loan repayment, child‚Äôs education, or marriage You rece",

    "question": "Portfolio Diversification: Types, Strategies, Benefits & Limitation",
    "answer": "NPS vs PPF: A Comparision Between the Two Popular Government SchemesJune 27, 2023Mutual Fund Diversification: Meaning, How it Works, and AdvantagesJune 27, 2023 Table of Contents Toggle One commonly used phrase in investing is ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt put all the eggs in one basket‚Äô. This means you have to spread your investments across asset classes and securities to reduce the risk of investing. This is known as diversification. It is a risk management technique used to reduce the downside risk in a portfolio and increase long-term returns. What is Portfolio Diversification? Diversification or portfolio diversification is a strategy that attempts to reduce the risk in a portfolio by spreading the investments across a wide variety of investments and asset classes. The basic idea behind investing across different investments is to reduce the downside risk and increase returns in the long term. However, it is important to note that diversification doesn‚Äôt guarantee returns, it only aims to mitigate the risk in investing. Diversification is done by spreading the investment across asset classes, instruments, industries, and geographies. In the case of asset classes, you can invest in equities, debt, gold, and real estate. With respect to diversification across instruments, there are shares, mutual funds, government securities, bonds, etc. You can also diversify by investing in securities across different industries and geographies. How Does Portfolio Diversification Help Reduce Risk in Investing? Offsets losses: With multiple asset classes in a portfolio, you are offsetting the losses of one asset class with profits from another asset class. This way, you are reducing the risk of a drastic loss in your portfolio. Hedging: By spreading your investments across instruments, asset classes, and geographies, you are less vulnerable to specific risks. For example, if you invest in debt securities of a company and it defaults on the payment, you have other securities in your portfolio to maintain the overall portfolio return. Imagine investing your entire money in the debt securities of this company. You would end up losing all your money. Since you diversified your investments, the returns from other securities are not affected. Reduces volatility: Since you invest in multiple asset classes, you have a portfolio of investments that have a low correlation to one another. This reduces the volatility and risk in the portfolio. Different Types of Portfolio Diversification There are different ways through which you can diversify your investment portfolio. Following are the different types of diversification. 1. Asset class diversification The ideal way to build an investment portfolio is to invest in different asset classes. Different assets react differently to changing economic conditions. Many asset classes move in different directions in certain situations. Take, for example, gold and equity. They move in opposite directions in many situations. Some asset classes soar during an inflationary environment, while others perform poorly. Commodities, gold, and stocks of industries such as the healthcare industry and consumer staples benefit from inflation. In contrast, consumer discretionary and construction equipment industries were affected by inflation. Hence by adding different asset classes to your portfolio, you can reduce the risk of losses. 2. Industry diversification The economy is made up of different industries, of which many are correlated, and many are not. Investing across industries will help maintain portfolio returns as losses of one industry are offset by the profits of another industry. This is because all industries move in cycles, and not all have similar cycles. In other words, when an industry is in the expansionary phase, the others might be in the contraction phase. Hence you must invest in different industries that are not correlated to ensure your portfolio is diverted. 3. Geographic diversification The world has become a global village. Travelling, shopping, and even investing across nations have become easier than before. In a world filled with developed, developing, and emerging nations, there are several investment opportunities available to you. All you have to do is invest in securities across different nations to reduce the country and currency risk in your portfolio. 4. Strategy diversification There are several investment strategies that are used by experts to build a portfolio. Some of them are growth, value, incom",

    "question": "Loan Against Mutual Funds: What is It? How to Get Loan Against Securities?",
    "answer": "Personal Loan Foreclosure ‚Äì All You Need To KnowNovember 27, 2024How to Check Loan Status?November 28, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle During an emergency, we experience a money crunch and tend to take out money from our savings, liquidate our investments, or take a loan. However, instead of liquidating your investment, you could take a loan against it. Although rare, several banks offer loans against your financial assets, such as mutual funds, shares, and other securities. It is always better to take a loan against your mutual funds than liquidate them. Read to find out how a loan against mutual fund works, what are the interest rates, and its advantages. What is a loan against mutual funds? When you borrow money against your mutual funds, using it as collateral, it is known as taking a loan against mutual funds. It is similar to taking a loan against your home, fixed deposit, or any other asset. In case you fail to pay, the bank or non-banking finance company (NBFC) will sell your investment to repay the loan. It is important to note that not all banks give loans against mutual funds; only some do. Hence you must check the bank‚Äôs website before applying for such a loan. The following are the features of loans against mutual funds: Instant processing: The loan against mutual funds is processed immediately after you get a lien on mutual funds from the fund house. A lien is a document that gives the bank or NBFC the right to sell the units in case of a default. You must physically visit the fund house‚Äôs office to get a lien on the bank‚Äôs name. Instant money: The money on the loan is instantly credited to your account after you submit the lien document. No liquidation: Even after you get the loan on mutual funds, you remain invested in them. The fund house will not liquidate your mutual fund investments. Continue to earn returns: Even if you pledge your mutual funds, you will earn a return on them as you are invested in the scheme. Just because you pledged the units doesn‚Äôt mean you will stop earning a return on it. Maximum limit of the loan: The quantum of the loan you get depends on the type of mutual fund you are invested in. For example, for equity mutual funds, the maximum loan you can get is 50% of the net asset value (NAV). In the case of debt mutual funds, it is 80% of the NAV. However, this varies across banks and NBFCs. Some banks offer up to 60% for equity funds and 85% for debt funds. The lower and upper limit of the loan: The minimum and maximum amount of loan you can get on mutual funds is fixed by banks and NBFCs. The minimum amount of loan you have to take against mutual funds is Rs 50,000, and the maximum is Rs 20 lakhs in the case of equity funds and Rs 1 crore for debt funds. The limit is higher in the case of NBFCs and can go up to Rs 25 lakhs for equity funds and Rs 10 crores for debt funds. Interest rate: The interest rate for mutual fund loans is lower than for personal or credit card loans. Hence, they are considered more affordable than other loans. The interest rate on mutual fund loans is usually around 11-15% per annum. Processing fee: The processing fee for mutual fund loans is usually between 0-1%, which is lesser than for other kinds of loans. Loan against approved schemes only: Not all mutual fund schemes are eligible for taking a loan. You must check the bank‚Äôs website to find out which schemes are eligible for taking a loan. Eligibility: To get a loan against a mutual fund, you must be a resident of India. NRIs, sole proprietors, partnership firms, private trusts, and public and private companies are also eligible to get a loan. However, minors are not eligible to get a loan. How does a loan against mutual funds work? When you take a loan against mutual funds, you are using it as collateral. This means the bank will use it as collateral until you repay back the entire loan. So this means you can continue to invest in the scheme, and you will earn a return and dividends as usual, but you cannot sell them. Even if you want to book profits or withdraw your money from a mutual fund, you will not be able to do it until you repay back the entire loan to the bank or NBFC. Once you repay the loan, the bank will ask the fund house to release the lien. Upon releasing the lien, you are free to redeem your mutual funds. In case you paid the loan partially, you can request the bank to partially release the lien on your mutual funds. This will free up some units while the rest remain under the contro",

    "question": "Credit Card Eligibility Criteria & Required Documents in India",
    "answer": "How to Withdraw Cash From Credit Card?August 6, 2024How to Transfer Money From Credit Card to Bank Account‚Äã?August 7, 2024 Table of Contents Toggle A credit card can significantly improve your credit profile and can also be an excellent savings tool. In India, where credit usage is not yet widespread, many people still view credit cards as a luxury rather than a practical financial tool. Despite this, the credit card industry in India has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% over the past five years, with the number of credit cards exceeding 78 million by July 2022. If you are considering applying for a credit card in India, you might be unsure about the eligibility requirements. Many people hesitate to apply because they fear they might not qualify. However, understanding the eligibility criteria can clarify this for you. In this blog, we‚Äôll explore how credit card eligibility works, so let‚Äôs get started. What are Credit Card Eligibility Criteria in India? Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key credit card eligibility criteria in India: Age To apply for a Credit Card, you typically need to be between 18 and 60 years old. This age range ensures that applicants are legally adults and not approaching retirement. Some card issuers may have slightly different age requirements. Income Your income is an important factor in determining credit card eligibility. Banks require proof of a stable income to ensure you can pay off your credit card bills. Different types of credit cards have varyingDebt minimum income requirements, with premium cards generally needing a higher income. Employment Status Your job status significantly affects your credit card application. Those with a salaried position often have an easier time securing a credit card because they can provide evidence of a regular income. Self-employed individuals and entrepreneurs can also qualify, but they need to demonstrate a higher stable income. Credit Score Your credit score, ideally above 750, reflects your history of managing credit responsibly. This score is derived from your credit history, including previous loans, credit cards, and your repayment behaviour. A high credit score indicates that you are a low-risk borrower. Residential Status YBoth resident Indians and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) can apply for credit cards. NRIs may need to provide additional documentation to verify their employment and living arrangements abroad. Banking Relationship If you already have an account with the bank, it might be easier to obtain a credit card. Your existing relationship with the bank can sometimes help offset lower credit scores or income levels. Existing Loans and Liabilities If you have other loans or significant debts, it can impact your credit card eligibility. Lenders evaluate your Debt-to-Income Ratio to ensure you can handle additional credit without becoming financially overextended. What are Documents Required for Credit Card? The specific documents required for a credit card application in India can vary slightly depending on the bank and the type of card you‚Äôre applying for. However, here are the most common documents you‚Äôll need: General Documents These documents are commonly required for most credit card applicants: Proof of Identity Aadhaar card, PAN card, passport, driving license, or voter ID card.

    "question": "How To Choose Recurring Deposit Interest Rates from Top Banks",
    "answer": "What is Mid Cap Fund ‚Äì Overview, Features, Advantages & DisadvantagesOctober 10, 2022Recurring Deposit: Features, Benefits, Eligibility & Interest RatesNovember 24, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle Recurring deposit interest rates are the rate of interest that is paid on deposits made into a recurring deposit account. The interest rate is usually fixed for the term of the deposit and can vary depending on the bank or financial institution. Recurring deposits typically have a higher interest rate than savings accounts but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals. Most banks and financial institutions offer a wide range of RD interest rates, so it is important to compare the rates before choosing an account. Recurring deposit rates can vary depending on the term of the deposit, the amount deposited, and the type of account. For example, some accounts may offer a higher recurring interest rate for a longer-term deposit, while others may offer a lower rate for a shorter-term deposit. It is also important to consider any fees or charges that may be associated with an account before choosing one. Overview of RD Interest Rates Particulars Details Interest Rate Range From 2.50 to 8.50 Minimum Deposit Amount Rs.10 (for post office RD) Tenure of the Investment 6 months to 10 years Interest Compound Frequency Quarterly Partial and Mid-term Withdrawal Not Allowed Premature Closure Allowed with a penalty *A post office recurring deposit can be started with as low as Rs. 10 RD interest rate is compounded quarterly. How to choose the best RD interest rates? The best RD interest rates will depend on your specific needs and goals. However, there are a few general tips that can help you choose the best rates: 1. Consider your time horizon: If you need the money sooner, you‚Äôll want to choose a shorter-term RD with lower interest rates. If you have more time, you can choose a longer-term RD and lock in higher interest rates. 2. Compare different banks and RDs: Some banks offer higher interest rates for longer terms, while others may have lower rates for shorter terms. It‚Äôs important to compare different banks‚Äô options before choosing an RD. 3. Keep an eye on the market: Interest rates are influenced by economic conditions. If interest rates are rising, you may want to lock in an RD now to avoid paying higher rates in the future. Conversely, if rates are falling, you may want to wait and see if you can get a better RD later on. 4. Compare RDs with other investment options: RDs are just one type of investment. Before choosing an RD, compare it with other options, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Each of the Investment options has its own set of pros and cons, so it‚Äôs important to understand all your options before investing. 5. Consider fees and taxes: Some RDs come with fees, such as account maintenance fees or early withdrawal penalties. And, depending on the type of RD, you may be subject to taxes on the interest you earn. Be sure to factor these into your decision before investing. These are just a few things to keep in mind when considering an RD. By doing your research and being aware of the potential risks, you can make sure that you‚Äôre making the best decision for your financial future. Current RD Interest Rates RD Interest Rates in all banks differ from one another. Many banks offer a good interest rate on recurring deposits. However, the best bank for recurring deposits may vary from person to person. It all depends on the individual‚Äôs needs and preferences. The highest RD interest rates are generally offered by large banks. However, smaller banks and credit unions may also offer competitive rates. It is always best to compare rates from different banks before deciding which one to choose.

    "question": "A Comprehensive Overview to Investing in Sectoral Mutual Funds",
    "answer": "What is Gold ETF ‚Äì Overview, Advantages, Disadvantages & How to InvestOctober 3, 2022Fixed Maturity Plans: Features, Pros, Cons & InvestingOctober 3, 2022 Table of Contents Toggle A sectoral mutual fund, as the name suggests, is an equity fund wherein the fund is invested in businesses belonging to the same industry. Such investments let investors expose their capital to a particular sector by investing in funds from the same industry. These kinds of funds are popular among mass investors and those who believe that a particular sector has immense growth potential in the near future. If you are unaware of what sector mutual funds are and how they function, we are here to help! This article discusses sector funds to help you decide whether they are right for you. How do sectoral funds work? The Indian market is divided into multiple sectors: pharmaceutical, manufacturing, banking, technology, etc. Besides, there are several niche sectors. Some of these sectors have been around for a long time. They have consistently delivered high returns, making them good investments. Sectoral funds are built with the intent to help investors capitalise on returns from such industries. The primary difference between regular equity and sectoral funds is that the capital is invested in multiple stocks across different industries in the former. On the other hand, in sectoral funds, the money is invested in multiple stocks from the same sector. A sector is a collection of businesses that belong to the same industry and more or less function similarly. Two companies from the same sector produce the same output or service. For instance, Wipro belongs to the tech industry, as does Infosys. Who should invest in sectoral funds? Sectoral funds work on the principle of high risk, high returns. These funds invest in a particular sector. While it is never wise to put all your eggs in the same basket, sometimes it might work to your advantage. You should invest in sectoral funds only if you can afford to take risks, as sectoral funds lack diversification. All your money is invested in a single sector, jeopardizing your entire capital. If the sector hits an unexpected low, all your money will go down the drain. In sectoral funds, your money is highly dependent on the performance of the sector you invest in. Owing to the risks involved, you must venture into sectoral funds only if you are a seasoned investor. If you have actively invested for several years, you will clearly understand the market. This aspect will help you determine which sector will most likely do well in the near future. Picking the right sector to invest in is crucial regarding sectoral funds, and seeking expert advice is highly recommended. Things to consider while investing in a sectoral fund. Investment goals: While investing in any fund, you must consider where you see the investment going in five years. Your investment horizon should be a minimum of five years to maximise returns, as any investment needs at least five years to reach its peak.Before you actually invest a large sum into a particular sector, consider your long-term investment goals. Investment risks: Typically, high risk accompanies high returns. Irrespective of the kind of fund you invest in, there is always a risk of loss. Since you are banking on a single sector to give you returns, sectoral funds are riskier.At no given point are the chances of the sector facing a backlash null, and there is always a chance that you might face heavy losses. Hence, be aware of the risks involved before investing in an industry. If the market crashes, be prepared to face losses. Exposure limit: Exposing your capital to different kinds of investment ensures stability and financial security. Therefore, experts always recommend a diverse Investing portfolio. Exposing a lot of money to the same kind of investment is not advisable.Since sectoral funds are high-risk, investors must not expose more than 5-10 % of their money. Expense ratio: The expense ratio is the fund you need to spend to maintain your investment. Investment banking companies charge a nominal fee for efficient fund management. It is like a fee paid to the fund managers for taking charge of your investments.It would help if you considered the expense ratio as well. If the fund management of a particular investment is pricey, then there‚Äôs no point in investing in the particular fund.
