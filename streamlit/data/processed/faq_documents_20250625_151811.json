    "answer": "CarolinMerces (彡 𝕻𝖊𝖓𝖓𝖞𝖜𝖎𝖘𝖊 𝕿𝖍𝖊 𝕯𝖆𝖓𝖈𝖎𝖓𝖌 𝕮𝖑𝖔𝖜𝖓 彡) 15 April 2022 16:49 1 Hello Hiii, As you all know few days  Bullet was renamed by Jupiter Edge. But the issue is with the vkyc after completing the vkyc agent told check it after 5 mins it will get reviewed in 5 mins and even i got the notification that Account is ready for the use but but but Is still showing that review page. I know you may get a huge response but half of the application is getting waitlisted and half of the application get the option to complete the kyc but you guyz are not verifying it I just don’t know what is wrong at your end. Few user application is verified and they are using it as well. but what about us who is waiting from the month of august? Almost 10 months. If someone is reading this post from Jupiter Edge team request you to kindly verify all the application or reject all applications if you can’t verify. I know the holiday is started and now We have to wait 1-2 weeks more. Signing off, Carolin 1",
