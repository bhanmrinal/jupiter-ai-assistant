CRED saw it as Bank of America card (had to manually change it to CSB) and PayZapp saw it as a Discover card Could this be due to the pending activation of the physical card? Even if so, why is CSB not in the list of official banks supporting RuPay? 1",

It is very frustating at times. PS- I used my HDFC card to pay at all these after my transaction failed through the Jupiter card & the transaction went smooth. So clearly, the issue is within JUPITER ! This issue is very alarming and of huge concern. Even 2-3 transfers within the app failed too. I have reported the issue to the in-app chat support team but haven’t heard from them since last 2 days. I hope the issue gets resolved ASAP @Jiten 8 s 2021: The Year in Review",

    "answer": "Nav2024 (Naveen Kumar) 12 April 2024 12:58 1 It is understandable that we buy the digital gold with 3%gst. So there is variation in buying it. But why do the value decreases when we sell. For example if you buy 1G digi gold in jupiter for 6000 rupees with 3% gst (total u spent is 6180) the value invested is 6000rupees for 1 gram gold. Let’s say after 1 year now the app shows that ur invested value rouse up to 8000 but when you want sell. The value of ur investment will not be what they show (8000) rather it will be lower than that.  2-3% less. Why is it so? Could anyone explain why we are paying 2-3% again? Why can’t we get the actual value displayed? In my case - my invested value is showing as 60, 363.28 (which i bought after paying 3% gst) but if i want to sell it now, it only shows that i will receive 58,283.78 rupees. So, my question is where is the remaining 2079.50? Looks  am loosing again some money… So what’s the use of jupiter digi gold purchase? Looks  a gimmick to me. What makes digi gold better if we r stil loosing money. Iam thinking buying gold coins and saving at  looks more profitable… Any enlightenment is much appreciated…",

I keep depositing a predictable amount of money into a pot called “car repairs” and when it’s time to service the car I pay from this pot. Now the paying part is very cumbersome, I have to first withdraw from the pot which now costs 2 hours. Another example is if I have a medical account, so if a family member is ill, I may need to make several small payments over, say, 72 hours. It’s again cumbersome to pay from the main savings account and then calculate manually and withdraw from the pot. Ideally, one should be able to add a pot as a linked account. So while scanning a QR code I have an option to pay. This feature I do believe forces fiscal discipline  nothing else if the team can realize it. Maybe another type of pot (not ed by FD necessarily, the idea is not earning a return but keeping expense accounts segregated. Overall a great app and cheers to the team.",

    "answer": "Shawnpinto (Shawn Pinto) 8 February 2024 13:17 1 Hi everyone! We’re  with another uncomfortable situation around money. Most of us have already faced this. So let’s get to it. Situation for the week You’ve lent some money to your friend. He wanted to buy something urgently and didn’t have the funds at that moment. Since you’re his friend, and trying to help him out, you’ve lent him the money. A few weeks later, your friend seems relaxed and looks  he has the funds to buy things for himself. On a random day, both of you go for lunch and while paying the bill, he hesitates. Nudging you to pay the bill instead. Remember, he still owes you the money you’ve lent. Yet, asks for more by paying his . It’s a common story: a friend in need, an open hand, and a promise to repay. But what happens when that promise lingers unfulfilled, leaving you caught between financial strain and a strained friendship? The situation is delicate. You value your friend, yet the unpaid loan creates tension. Every reminder feels awkward, every unanswered message stings. Your choices You will need to pick 1 of the below choices: I would recall the money I lent him I would pay the bill now, remind him to pay both later Make him pay now and recall the the money I lent Something else? Comment below! 0 voters Ultimately, the decision is yours Remember, clear communication and setting boundaries early on can prevent such situations in the future. Lending money can be an act of friendship, but it’s crucial to treat it  a financial transaction as well, protecting both your wallet and your bond. So, what would you do in this situation?
